Typically Ronin is reimbursed for expenses, rather than holding funds for a grant. There are two exceptions and Ronin was holding something on the order of $35k for those two grants. In theory, the grant PI could move their funds, but in reality RI needs someone authorized on the</span><span>&nbsp;bank account</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to do that. Historically, grant funds are held in the Ronin bank account. The accounting side of grant management was managed by an external firm.

It also may be hard for newcomers or others in the community to see what needs to be done. The idea of this dashboard would be to make this transparent. We could all see if key tasks started slipping, and we could step in to help. We could see where our time might be most urgently invested. I imagine anyone could add a dial or task, so we could start doing new things. While we are doing things related to a specific dial, we&rsquo;d manually send updates to the dashboard to keep the dial in the green. If updates are missing, the dial moves away from green, altering the community that things are not being done (but hopefully not in a way that places undue burden or guilt on any volunteer, just to allow others to step up). If a dial drifts to red, then we stop doing that thing, and the dial is removed. And if all dials drift to red&hellip;well then we close. But we could all see why we would be closing.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h3 class="c20 c39" id="h.vjleuwta9im0"><span class="c2"></span></h3><h3 class="c20" id="h.okmlmbx76yuw"><span class="c2">Appendix A.

Data Breach Email</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The following email was sent from the &quot;board of directors&quot; email address board@ronininstitute.org on 2024-03-28 . </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Note that Arika V. refuted the claim by commenting on 2024-04-08 in this google doc &quot;I can also assure you that it was NOT a data breach. It was a miscommunication--simply someone internally doing a back up of the system.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">---</span></p><p class="c64"><span class="c26">Dear Ronin Scholars,</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c26">Regrettably, the Board is writing to inform you of a data breach on the Ronin Institute server. An unauthorized download of the website, email accounts, and databases from the Ronin Institute server to a personal computer and subsequently to a private, remotely hosted server account has come to our attention. These were carried out without authorization or knowledge of the Board of Directors.</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c26">We learned only on Sunday March 25 that, for a whole month from, we believe, February 24, data from the cpanel of the Institute&rsquo;s web server was backed up and downloaded onto an individual&rsquo;s personal home computer. The data contained the website, its databases, and also the personal email accounts of the entire Ronin Institute membership. The individual who carried out this unauthorized activity was immediately notified to remove all data from the home computer, and any other Server, remote or otherwise, and to then send email confirmation that permanent deletion was complete. This confirmation was provided to us on March 26. A day later, on March 27, we subsequently learned by accident that these data have also been migrated to a Namecheap Hosting server account, privately owned by this individual. Until that time we had no knowledge of this, we were never informed, and the new server account cannot be accessed by the Board. Bluntly, this is a full breach of records on the Ronin Institute server.</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c26">The Board acknowledges its obligations to swiftly and directly address this matter. Accordingly, the individual concerned has been removed from their post in the Institute, appropriate authorities have been informed of this breach of personal data, and Namecheap Hosting is being informed of this activity, and that they are to delete all information related to the Ronin Institute from their servers.</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c26">All Ronin Scholars must realize that these data are not only personal (e.g. private Email addresses) but may also include personal financial information, contracts, including government contracts, connections with government projects and agencies, and details of (federal) grants that are confidential, and may also be sensitive in nature. In addition, administrative email accounts include company data such as invoices, payroll, retirement, and financial accounting. Simply put, this unknown and unauthorized download from the Institute server to personal or other computers/devices/servers in any form whatsoever, should not have taken place. We have been assured (March 28) that all the data have been deleted. Having said this, since this Board has no access to the private computer, or hosting server with the clone of the Institute website and database, we cannot say what may have been done with the data, nor whether access/permission has been given for others to make copies of the data as well.</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c26">Please be patient as we await word from authorities on how to proceed. We will keep you informed as we learn more.</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c26">Respectfully,</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c26">Dana, Cheryl, Jens</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c57">-</span><span class="c54">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c26">The Board of Directors</span></p><h4 class="c31" id="h.iie7yywk2my2"><span>Appendix C1. </span><span>Scholar discussion about data breach</span></h4><p class="c1"><span>Please see </span><span class="c13"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ronininstitute.slack.com/archives/C0990RJP3/p1712390252971839&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1746036041516052&amp;usg=AOvVaw1TSLxmBHfTxmgQlqfaQXzG">comments in Slack </a></span><span>about the data breach, also copied below for convenience, or in the event Slack goes away </span><span>unexpectedly&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Actually it was never hacked and there was no real data breach. &nbsp;The board didn&#39;t understand that there wasn&#39;t enough disk space on Ronin systems to run a backup and the volunteer who had been doing that made a backup on his own system and went out and got a new server space off his machine to hold it until Ronin could get a bigger disk space; but when he told the Board that, rather than thanking him they sent out that ridiculous email and canned </span><span>him</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So of course, there is no one maintaining the infrastructure at the moment. &nbsp;And how you even can fire someone who is volunteering, especially when there are no standard operating procedures and one of the very first rules of conduct for Ronin is to &quot;Act in Good Faith and Assume Good Faith from Others&quot; I do not know; but the moment I saw that email, I knew the organization was probably dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">On the other hand, given that he followed their instructions to delete stuff off his machine, etc. the only data breach I can think of is that it isn&#39;t clear to me that the Board has a clue how to manage the main copy of the data on the Ronin servers, especially now that they all have resigned... &nbsp;Now that is very, very concerning (speaking as someone who has run several grants and contracts through Ronin).</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c43 c5"><span class="c26"></span></p><h3 class="c31" id="h.7nqbjboyj39z"><span class="c2">Appendix D: Ronin Institute most recent Tax Returns?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>Form 990s filed with the IRS can be looked up online at </span><span class="c13"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/details/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1746036041522697&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GWq3zLUH5o152cr0q26vC">https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/details/</a></span><span>.

The system will build upon work in Information Retrieval and Data Science and upon existing investment from NSF Polar, EarthCube, and from DARPA and NASA in this area. The system will collect, analyze, and make interactive the wealth of textual and scientific Polar data collected to date across the Deep web of scientific information -- scientific journals, multimedia information, scientific data, web pages, etc. The system builds upon fundamental research in text analysis, search, and visualization. Its primary goal is to unlock unstructured scientific data from 90+ data formats and to scale to 10s-100s of millions of records using the NSF XSEDE supercomputing resources. The system will perform information retrieval and machine learning on data crawled from the Polar Deep and Scientific web. Crawling will be informed by science questions crowdsourced through the EarthCube and Polar communities. The project is a collaboration with NSIDC, Ronin Institute, and the broader community including the newly funded Arctic Data Center led by NCEAS, to build our proposed system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of periodic and regular crawling will be a Crawl Data Repository (CDR) of raw textual data e.g., web pages containing richly curated dataset abstract descriptions, news stories tied to datasets, ASCII note files and dataset descriptions, and other textual data available on or pointed to by Polar repositories as well as scientific data (HDF, Grib, NetCDF, Matlab, etc.). The CDR will be made available for historical and future analysis by the broader EarthCube and Polar communities. In addition, an extraction pipeline will generate an Extraction Data Repository (EDR) of machine learning features not previously present (geospatial, temporal, people, places, scientific publications and topics, etc.) that will be the basis of interactive, visual analytics over the Polar data resources. Information collected will assist in answering scientific questions such as these derived from the President?s National Strategy for the Arctic Region. To date, the team has also crowd sourced 30+ questions from the Polar community represented on CRYOLIST https://goo.gl/4dDyIS and will continue to solicit this feedback and use the information collected to aid science as prioritized by the community. They will also engage the community to assist in validating our system. This is not a predictive tool per-se ? though it can help to enable such predictions. Its focus is on building an operational and core capability for textual scientific data analysis, both retrospective, and prospective.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Number: 1558192</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Title: INTEROP: &nbsp;International Network of Arctic Knowledge</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Org: OAC Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Initial Amendment Date: July 07, 2016</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Latest Amendment Date: July 07, 2016</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Instrument: Standard Grant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Manager: Robert Chadduck</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Start Date: July 01, 2015</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">End Date: September 30, 2016</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awarded Amount to Date: $25,598</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">ARRA Amount: $</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Investigator(s): Ruth Duerr ruth.duerr@ronininstitute.org (Principal Investigator) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Organization: Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship Incorporated</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">127 HADDON PL, MONTCLAIR, NJ 07043-2314, (973)707-2485</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Directorate: CSE</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program(s): Polar Cyberinfrastructure </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Reference Code(s): </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Element Code(s): 540700</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Abstract: Award: &nbsp;0956010&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mark Parsons&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: &lt;br/&gt;Community-based Data Interoperability (INTEROP)International Network of Arctic Knowledge (INAK)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid Arctic change has critical implications for global climate, biodiversity, geopolitics, international transportation, and local society. To understand and respond to this change and its implications, it is necessary to understand the Arctic as a system. The International Polar Year (IPY) was a huge international effort to improve our interdisciplinary understanding of the Arctic and Polar Regions, how they are changing, and their impact on the Earth system and human society. IPY produced a large, diverse array of data that increases the challenge of interdisciplinary data discovery and use. The data is enriched, but the challenge is increased, by the explicit inclusion of social science research and local and traditional knowledge of the Arctic. Yet, IPY and the rapid change in the Arctic have generated considerable international resolve and formal collaboration that can be harnessed to improve the semantic understanding and interoperability of Arctic data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSIDC, working with domain and community-building experts at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and elsewhere, use the opportunity of IPY and the developing Polar Information Commons to improve the knowledge and interoperability of sea ice and related Arctic data through the extension and enhancement of an international data management network. Through focused workshops and broad community interaction, a formal, sea-ice ontology, and an expansive interdisciplinary knowledge framework for the Arctic are developed. Proven and maturing semantic web methodologies and ontology creation tools, including visual tools like concept maps, are used to develop the underlying infrastructure. The support and ongoing evolution of this infrastructure relies on the engagement of the people and communities who use, enhance, and maintain that infrastructure?the INAK. The need for interdisciplinary understanding of the Arctic system (driven by the profound changes in the Arctic) motivates the network, and the occasion of the IPY provides a unique opportunity and mechanism to develop the network, but ultimately, the network is sustained when members see how their network activities benefit their immediate scientific and practical science needs. The project engages the diverse Arctic community, including Arctic residents and indigenous people, to contribute to and use the INAK. Ultimately, the ontologies go beyond direct data user needs and grow the INAK and Arctic semantic insights into the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Number: 2034493</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Title: Broadening the Academic Data Science Community</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Org: IIS Div Of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Initial Amendment Date: September 10, 2020</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Latest Amendment Date: March 30, 2022</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Instrument: Standard Grant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Manager: Sylvia Spengler</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Start Date: October 01, 2020</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">End Date: December 31, 2022</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awarded Amount to Date: $60,000</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">ARRA Amount: $</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Investigator(s): Micaela Parker micaela@academicdatascience.org (Principal Investigator) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Organization: Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship Incorporated</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">127 HADDON PL, MONTCLAIR, NJ 07043-2314, (973)707-2485</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Directorate: CSE</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program(s): IIS Special Projects </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Reference Code(s): 7364 7556</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Element Code(s): 748400</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Abstract: The Academic Data Science Alliance (ADSA) was created to enable the broad dissemination of new approaches and best practices in data science to colleges and universities nationwide. ADSA?s goals are to provide community resources and events for academic data scientists at any level to share research advances and educational approaches. ADSA also provides a collaboration space for university leadership to share their challenges and success stories around programs for data science. ADSA supports a peer network of early career academic data scientists to forge collaborations and implement novel training approaches on their campuses. &nbsp;This project supports the ADSA Annual Meeting and the Data Science Leadership Summit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADSA Annual Meeting provides an opportunity for academic researchers at any level (graduate students, postdocs, staff researchers and faculty) to collectively address common issues in data science research, education and training, program administration, and advocacy for data scientist career paths in higher education. The Data Science Leadership Summit convenes heads of current and nascent data science programs, and faculty interested in creating new initiatives on their campuses: to form an academic community for data science; to share best practices where they face similar challenges and opportunities; and to take collective responsibility in preparing next-generation data scientists to contribute in the best interests of society. The ADSA Career Development Network provides a peer-network for early career academic data scientists to support each other in their professional development. &nbsp;Outcomes from these meetings are provided online for public consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF&#39;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&#39;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Number: 2135830</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Title: Identifying Assets and Collaborative Activities to Support Student Success in Environmental Data Science at Minority Serving Institutions</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Org: DUE Division Of Undergraduate Education</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Initial Amendment Date: August 24, 2021</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Latest Amendment Date: August 24, 2021</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Instrument: Standard Grant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Manager: Mike Ferrara</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Start Date: October 01, 2021</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">End Date: May 31, 2023</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awarded Amount to Date: $99,909</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">ARRA Amount: $</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Investigator(s): Micaela Parker micaela@academicdatascience.org (Principal Investigator) Krystal Tsosie (Co-Principal Investigator) Kari Jordan (Co-Principal Investigator) Talitha Washington (Co-Principal Investigator) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Organization: Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship Incorporated</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">127 HADDON PL, MONTCLAIR, NJ 07043-2314, (973)707-2485</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Directorate: EDU</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program(s): IUSE </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Reference Code(s): 102Z 7556 8209 9178</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Element Code(s): 199800</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Abstract: This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing capacity in environmental data science through improved access to training and workforce development resources for diverse student populations. Racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States are under-supported and under-represented in data science programs and careers. Multiple challenges, including the affordability, access to new technologies and the lack of educational opportunities for diverse students, have led to a digital divide that demonstrates inequities in access to data, technology and educational opportunities. Data science education at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) can narrow this divide by engaging diverse student and faculty populations who have the knowledge and skills required to address issues of social and cultural relevance. MSIs have proven to be effective at recruiting, retaining, and preparing under-represented students for the STEM workforce. This project seeks to bring together representatives from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and &nbsp;Universities (TCUs), and professional organizations to build resource networks, identify barriers to data science education, and co-create a set of recommendations focusing &nbsp;specifically on environmental sciences, thus empowering and supporting equitable data science education and training opportunities that ameliorate the digital divide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus on environmental data science springs from two factors that indicate strong workforce needs nationwide: a significant increase in large ecological datasets and environmental synthesis projects over the last decade and the growing national awareness of critical environmental challenges. &nbsp;The project team includes representatives from the Academic Data Science Alliance, Native BioData Consortium, Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative, the SCORE-UBE Network, The Carpentries and the National Environmental Observation Network and the project will engage a broad collection of additional academic and community partners. This project will organize monthly HBCU and TCU working group meetings and a series of mini-workshops to meet the following goals: 1) identify the unique assets that HBCUs and TCUs bring to environmental data science education; 2) analyze barriers to adoption of data science in teaching relevant courses; 3) identify and raise awareness of resources available to support equitable data science education; 4) promote relationship-building among faculty and partner organizations, forming the basis of a network for future resource sharing and curriculum development with peer support; and, 5) collaboratively develop a living document with recommendations that will enhance student success in environmental data science. Project activities will allow participants, with support from a Leadership Committee and community partners, to identify institutional assets and challenges, and how to best leverage partnerships to enhance data science capacity at HBCUs and TCUs. The project will build relationships and concentrate activities on identifying shared solutions that can be adopted within a variety of contexts and scales. Information gathered during all workshops and the project evaluation will be incorporated in a living document with recommendations that will be disseminated to all network partners and to the wider data science community. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF&#39;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&#39;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Number: 1934649</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Title: Research Data Alliance Ideate Incubator (RDA-I2) : Conceptualizing an Interdisciplinary Research Framework for Strengthening Community Impact and Advancing an Innovation Platform</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Org: OAC Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Initial Amendment Date: February 20, 2020</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Latest Amendment Date: August 26, 2020</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Instrument: Standard Grant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Manager: Alejandro Suarez</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Start Date: February 01, 2020</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">End Date: November 30, 2023</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awarded Amount to Date: $2,202,049</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">ARRA Amount: $</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Investigator(s): Rebecca Koskela rebecca.koskela@rda-foundation.org (Principal Investigator) Leslie McIntosh-Borrelli (Former Principal Investigator) Lynn Yarmey (Co-Principal Investigator) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Organization: Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship Incorporated</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">127 HADDON PL, MONTCLAIR, NJ 07043-2314, (973)707-2485</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Directorate: CSE</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program(s): CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Reference Code(s): 7231</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Element Code(s): 723100</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Abstract: The Research Data Alliance (RDA) is a global organization providing a community infrastructure of researchers, data scientists, librarians, practitioners who work within and across disciplines to identify and solve grand challenges of data sharing and interoperability. &nbsp;This project augments the RDA infrastructure with an incubator framework that can be used to accelerate data sharing and data-driven innovation, by providing targeted community support and strategic dissemination of community outputs. The goals are to establish mechanisms to integrate and link work across different RDA working groups and improve the discoverability and usability of RDA outputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a pilot facilitation training program for RDA group chairs, to share strategies and tactics for building better connections across efforts. In a quickly-scaling organization, the chairs are uniquely placed as a consistent, visible leadership presence for all group participants. By equipping chairs with skills to lead more inclusive session discussions that give space to the knowledge of the many participants, RDA can better leverage the Plenary meetings to connect groups. A second goal of the project is to increase the intelligibility and discoverability of RDA outputs, to prepare for broader adoption of the RDA work. RDA&#39;s current process of documenting and tracking approved and supported RDA outputs makes it difficult to capture the full array of work associated with RDA, including publications, posters, lectures, webinars, white-papers, and adoption stories. Developing a strategy to better track output development and adoption would enhance the capability to support all group work and to monitor, measure, and disseminate the impact of RDA group outputs within the wider scientific community. In addition, enhancing the documentation of organizational outputs would improve the ability of group collaboration and cross-fertilization of ideas, as outputs are reused and adapted to additional purposes, methods, and audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF&#39;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&#39;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Number: 2213732</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Title: Microstructure Research Data Workshop at the South Big Data Innovation Hub</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Org: OAC Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Initial Amendment Date: April 04, 2022</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Latest Amendment Date: April 04, 2022</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Instrument: Standard Grant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Manager: Plato Smith</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Start Date: May 01, 2022</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">End Date: June 30, 2023</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awarded Amount to Date: $50,000</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">ARRA Amount: $</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Investigator(s): Eva Campo eva.campo@ronininstitute.org (Principal Investigator) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Organization: Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship Incorporated</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">127 HADDON PL, MONTCLAIR, NJ 07043-2314, (973)707-2485</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Directorate: CSE</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program(s): NSF Public Access Initiative </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Reference Code(s): 7556</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Element Code(s): 741400</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Abstract: This workshop will bring together experts to advance public accessibility and interoperation standards for microstructural material science datasets, a category of data that has broad utility for many areas of materials science research. &nbsp;The workshop builds on previous workshops, which succeeded in identifying targeted gaps in microstructure descriptors commonly used in manufacturing to correlate synthesis and macroscopic properties that determine structural performance. &nbsp;This workshop aims at identifying metadata needed to enable interoperability of distributed and federated microstructure data worldwide. &nbsp;The identification and adoption of these metadata standards will have widespread practical impacts in manufacturing, and be pursued through community engagement and consensus building. &nbsp;The results of this workshop will have the potential to dramatically advance manufacturing industries; efficiently developing synthesis strategies towards targeted structural performance, that could include resilience to extreme environments such as nuclear reactors and wind farms, to extreme weather conditions (coastal erosion), to fatigue in bridges, and to earthquake damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will focus on FAIR principles-oriented specifications for data management issues that were deemed crucial to the data science enterprise in previous gatherings, including: 1) metadata curation, 2) data ownership, provenance and sharing, 3) ontologies and schema, etc. &nbsp;The workshop will include a number of tracks: Data Science Education and Workforce, Manufacturing, Team Science, Smart Cities, Data Sharing, and Health Disparities. In addition, the materials track will reach out to the other tracks and will: 1) connect with experts in resilient cities and ask what properties in cement, steel, etc. they are concerned with and incorporate those in the case studies, 2) connect with experts in Team Science for advice on how to efficiently execute the actionable items identified in the workshop, and 3) connect with experts in Workforce development for help in crafting a training program for data technicians in this realm (e.g. how much data science and how much materials science would a technician, researcher, etc. need to know to work in this space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF&#39;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&#39;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Number: 2115108</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Title: I-Corps: Leveraging the computational power of a quantum annealer to optimize the methods and technologies in the logistics and supply-chain industry</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Org: TI Translational Impacts</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Initial Amendment Date: March 31, 2021</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Latest Amendment Date: March 31, 2021</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Instrument: Standard Grant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Manager: Ruth Shuman</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Start Date: March 15, 2021</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">End Date: February 28, 2022</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awarded Amount to Date: $50,000</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">ARRA Amount: $</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Investigator(s): Vesselin Gueorguiev vesselin.gueorguiev@ronininstitute.org (Principal Investigator) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Organization: Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship Incorporated</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">127 HADDON PL, MONTCLAIR, NJ 07043-2314, (973)707-2485</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Directorate: TIP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program(s): I-Corps </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Reference Code(s): 7203</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Element Code(s): 802300</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Abstract: The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology to increase efficiency and reduce the costs incurred in decision-making that involves multiple variables along with several possible combinations of such variables. This technology leverages the power of a Quantum Computer (QC) for a faster and more efficient computational potential, which helps businesses in rapid decision making. This proposed technology may be applied to several industry segments such as finance, logistics and supply chain, and drug discovery. In particular, logistics and supply chain companies may benefit significantly from this technology by making faster and more efficient decisions on route to optimization, warehouse management, inventory management, and last-mile delivery. &nbsp;This may allow companies to reduce fuel emissions, spend less on energy, and improve customer service. Companies also may save on resource management and reduced errors in judgment, where a small fraction of cost savings result in large savings. Commercializing this technology may have an economic benefit as well as a positive impact from an environmental perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a set of algorithms to solve complex distribution problems. &nbsp;Based on a COVID-19 vaccine distribution model, the solution targets advising and monitoring a safe reopening process by suggesting measures to be implemented by businesses within cities and counties. &nbsp;The algorithms will also suggest effective supply distributions patterns to optimize impact on limited resource and to develop and enhance mitigation procedures and supply delivery processes for potential large-scale disasters. This proposed technology has the potential to help address critical elements relevant to emergency and disaster mitigation as well as better and more efficient distributions of goods. The goal is to develop a full-fledged software product to be used by a variety of businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF&#39;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&#39;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Number: 1639675</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Title: EarthCube Building Blocks: &nbsp;Collaborative Proposal: Polar Data Insights and Search Analytics for the Deep and Scientific Web</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Org: RISE Div of Res, Innovation, Synergies, &amp; Edu</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Initial Amendment Date: September 16, 2016</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Latest Amendment Date: September 16, 2016</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Award Instrument: Standard Grant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Manager: Eva Zanzerkia</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Start Date: September 01, 2016</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">End Date: August 31, 2020</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awarded Amount to Date: $294,999</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">ARRA Amount: $</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Investigator(s): Siri Jodha Khalsa khalsa@colorado.edu (Principal Investigator) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Organization: University of Colorado at Boulder</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3100 MARINE ST, Boulder, CO 80309-0001, (303)492-6221</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NSF Directorate: GEO</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program(s): Polar Cyberinfrastructure EarthCube </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Reference Code(s): 1079 7433</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Program Element Code(s): 540700, 807400</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Abstract: This project develops an NSF EarthCube Building Block focused on Polar Data Science.

The CDR will be made available for historical and future analysis by the broader EarthCube and Polar communities. In addition, an extraction pipeline will generate an Extraction Data Repository (EDR) of machine learning features not previously present (geospatial, temporal, people, places, scientific publications and topics, etc.) that will be the basis of interactive, visual analytics over the Polar data resources. Information collected will assist in answering scientific questions such as these derived from the President?s National Strategy for the Arctic Region. To date, the team has also crowd sourced 30+ questions from the Polar community represented on CRYOLIST https://goo.gl/4dDyIS and will continue to solicit this feedback and use the information collected to aid science as prioritized by the community. They will also engage the community to assist in validating our system. This is not a predictive tool per-se ? though it can help to enable such predictions.
