About this document
(Note: see version history)


On 2024-04-05, the Ronin Board of Directors sent an email to announce their decision to dissolve the Ronin Institute, along with their intention to resign.  With this document, we'd like to collaborate with fellow Ronin Scholars (Immediate Goal - IG0) to explore how to (Additional Goal AG1) retain the community, (AG2) retain the services, (AG3) do a retrospective of what led to the resignation (AG4) formulate a short/long term plan to foster independent scholarship. For things not fitting this structure, there is the Open Space section.


The overall goal is to make an effort to connect and share ideas on what is next for those associated with Ronin Institute.

Open Questions
Tier 1
* What issues have caused the Board to decide that dissolving the institute is necessary? 
* What is the current legal status of the Ronin Institute? 
* What is the current capacity of the (former?) Board of Directors? Do they still legally represent Ronin as an Institute? If not, how do we elect an interim Board? 
* What are the available paths forward for any current Ronin facilitated grant holders?
Tier 2
* Does the dissolution resolve the issues in any way or do they persist, and if so, how?
* What was the nature of the data incident - an act of sabotage, an attempt to help or something else entirely?  (what data incident??) See Appendix C. Data Breach Email 
* What happens to the assets or liabilities (digital or otherwise) of the Ronin Institute (e.g., internet domain registration, logo copyright, taxes, bank account, outstanding grants)?
* What are alternative not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organizations that will permit you to have PI status and accept Ronin's 10% de minimis Indirect Costs or 25% overhead [citation needed] with NSF?
Action Items (who is working on what)
1. (Jorrit/Daniel, done) Propose a framework to collaborate on ways to reframe Ronin and learn from this experience. Note by Jorrit: This current "Reframing Ronin" document was created to help encourage discussion in the short term. It appears the next step is to set up a Governance WG to enable decision-making on important things like: infrastructure, communication channels etc. 
2. (ongoing[g][h], see associated doc for more info) Set up round of meetings[i][j][k][l][m], and follow the standard Ronin Governance model step by step request members to vote on decisions see alsoCONSENSUS GOVERNANCE PROCESS AND TOOLS.
Draft open[n][o] letter to the board expressing a sense of our opinions as Ronin Scholars regarding the current status of our community, and especially our need for information about why the decisions were made.
3. (Rami Saydjari/Ongoing) We should endeavor in any contact with the board to obtain the latest backup of the website and member database. A great deal of sweat equity, and frankly intellectual property were invested in its creation. Any Ronin members with back channel access to the current board members are encouraged to advocate on our behalf for release of this intellectual property. 


Immediate Goals
IG0. Appreciate all the work that went into Ronin - the countless hours spent on keeping the organization alive, the effort put into resolving conflict, dealing with massive amounts of paperwork, and carrying the weight of unprocessed events and miscommunication. Despite all our differences, I believe we have many things in common, especially the pursuit of independent scholarship. (I am feeling a bit cheesy now, but I think I mean it. . . ). In short - figure out how to hit the "pause" button, thank each other and reflect.


IG1. Confirm with the Board their decision to resign Determine the next steps for having formal leadership in place to make crucial decisions. An “interim board”? 
* Do we need to issue an acceptance of resignation letter and get as many scholars as possible to sign it?  Also, find out who owns /controls the digital resources (entered a to do item in the consensus doc)
* The Ronin Bylaws (see Appendix B. Ronin Bylaws) appear to give full power to the Board of Directors to do whatever they want, regardless of the desires of other members of the Ronin Institute. Hence, non-officers accepting (or not accepting) the Board’s decisions is at most symbolic in meaning, and not of any legal consequence.


* We'd like to see/know the  dissolution plans of the current Ronin Board
* Decide whether/who is to write, sign, and send an open letter to the Ronin Board expressing the outcomes of our current collaboration and express our the desires of the folks (likely a subset of Ronin Scholars)  that signed the letter.  (see associated action item above)




IG2. Understand what the scope of the problem is, and why the Board thinks that dissolving the institute is a necessary step.. Host a listening session with the current board and any former Advisory Board members who are willing to attend. This will help us decide if we can reform the current institute or need to create a new one (in the case that the financial/legal circumstances are insurmountable). 


IG3. Organize ourselves (highest priority), decide a governance structure and process, document the process 


IG4. Follow an agreed upon decision-making approach: 
* Consensus Model for Decision Making (see also https://www.sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/). Paola’s Note: Happy Medium for whom?. Please see the Consensus document for a discussion, we may adopt the do-ocracy consensus model whereby a motion is passed unless more than 25 percent of the voter base object, or something. For more details see separate document at CONSENSUS GOVERNANCE PROCESS AND TOOLS.
  



* Establish communication channels (suggest to cross-post announcements across slack/disord/google groups for the time being as all three channels appear active)
   * candidates: 
      * Slack https://app.slack.com/client/T0990TU4V
      * Discord (a dedicated discord server is available at https://discord.gg/hEZNGvVV ) 
      * Google Group started on April 7th  please join!
* (inspired by Paola/Brandon/Evangelos comment thread) Create Voter Roll (who can vote? how to register to vote?) and establish a method to create, distribute, and publish resolutions to vote on.
      * Use Loomio[p][q]? 
      * Use slido?   
      * Google Forms — 100% free survey tool.
      * SurveyPlanet — Best for unlimited question types and responses.
      *          * (Paola) have Governance WG facilitate voting for the time being. 
It is not just a question of voting, it is a question of setting up a consensus governance process that members can be part of . Voting is part of a governance mechanism that has been missing from Ronin Institute (there was an intention of having it was never implemented) Here is a doc containing a suggested way to to about it, please contribute by asking edit access (so that only logged in editors can make edits)
(Evan) How cash strapped are we? I’m trying to gather information about possible voting/polling platforms and some of them come at a cost for teams of over 100 participants (of the order of, say, $60 per month). But they promise a more professional experience. Should we only aim at open source/free solutions? I’m unsure as to how developed they are at the moment, I must say…  someone suggested google forms, free, reliable. Transparent, I d consider that. Yes, I am researching that one too. (Evan)
* * Set up an organizational structure, formulate and distribute tasks 
   * Who's doing what? 
   * What needs to be done?
      * Are there any legal obligations that need attention?
         * According to Bylaws, only the board of directors is responsible for Ronin as an organization[r][s][t][u]. 
Additional Goals
AG1. Retaining community 
How can we make sure that Ronins can stay in touch ?
Answer 1: By joining the Google group 
Answer 2: By joining the Discord discussion space
Answer 3: Continue with the Ronin Slack workspace for now, since every time you change infrastructure in a community, you lose people. At this point, we need to stick together. 
Answer 4: Linkedin
Answer 5: Create a membership database by (or get control of the current one which exists as the newsletter.
AG2. Retaining services 
Here are the services that the Ronin Institute provides: 
1. Sponsored Research Office
2. Human Subjects Research ethics review (via Rutgers U.)
   1. Background: Exempt review was offered at Ronin without a cost to membership for about a year up until March 2023. , but it was a cost to Ronin and only provided benefits to the few people who used it.  This program still officially exists,  so a scholar can still pay Rutgers to do the reviews (Ronin still has this relationship with Rutgers active). But without a qualified and formally appointed HSR chair, Ronin can no longer review protocols for in-house “Exempt” designation. These are guidelines set by the U.S. Federal Health and Human Services. 
3. Affiliation and membership (via the website). This affiliation has allowed members to obtain discounts on software and physical library access. This includes use of the Ronin institutional postal address and use of the Ronin logo.
   1. Current status: Website is owned by Jon Wilkins (previous Ronin Institute President). Admin is Dana Cohen and possibly others. [This claim is supported by publicly available information related to domain name registration information in Appendix F. : roninstitute.org domain was last renewed on 2024-03-09 via https://inmotionhosting.com , registered to organization "Jon Wilkins" and expires on 2025-03-19,] Attempts have been made over the last year to transfer the website to the new board (or Ronin controlling members/email alias address), but without success (JW did not respond and/or he did not follow through with requests). 
4. Communication with each other and self-organization (via Slack)
   1. Status: Owned by Jon Wilkins; Admin: Alex L., Dana C., Arika V., and Ronin alias. 
   2. Attempts have been made over the last year to transfer the website to the new board (or Ronin controlling members/email alias address), but without success (JW did not respond and/or he did not follow through with requests). 
5. Promoting the successes of our membership (via Newsletter and social media)
6. An email account for most members. As we ran out of disk space in 2022, we made it optional for members to have an email account. 


AG3. Retrospective
What led up to the board’s decision to dissolve? 
What led to Jon Wilkins and Arika to suddenly resign in 2023?
AG4. Formulating long/short term plans to continue to foster independent scholarship.
(existing or proposed plans to continue to foster independent scholarship)


[please feel free to add additional goals or reformulate existing ones]...


Here are some proposals that has come up so far:
1. Nick Halper, Executive Director of Neuromatch Inc. offers fiscal sponsorship or helping post-Ronin navigate starting a new non-profit
2. Merc Fox, Executive Director from CODATA offers to host the Ronin Institute to help preserve the current grants.
3. Gavin Taylor (global board member) and Rebecca Willen (founder) from IGDORE propose that Ronin becomes a US-IGDORE arm or an institutional affiliate, and they may be able to help provide some basic resources to help get us started. 
4. Arika Virapongse proposes that the community of the Ronin Institute re-organizes into a new nonprofit cooperative[v][w][x][y][z][aa][ab][ac][ad][ae][af][ag][ah] (with an entirely new name and branding) that initially aims to preserve/prioritize the community and stabilize the infrastructure/governance. It should separate itself completely from the Ronin Institute, and in time may be able to administer grants again. Importantly, in the organizational structure of a cooperative the members (research scholars) would cooperatively own the corporation, which is substantially different to the current organizational structure of the Ronin Institute.
5. The formation of a new company was  proposed by Paola Di Maio in an email to all on 5th of March


If proposal No. 4 is finally selected, we will probably need to apply for a new 501(c)(3) legal status(?). What is the cost, and how do we plan to raise this initial amount? 
* Crowdfunding? (This could use a popular crowdfunding platform, and could include a one-off appeal to members and the wider public. In the longer term, it could be used for regular appeals, sponsored events, etc.)
* Philanthropic funding?  (We could make contact with other organisations which receive funding from foundations etc and learn what works from them. Ronin’s aims and ethos could be a good match for many foundations. However, they may have their own criteria for governance of recipients.)
* Member contributions?


The Law Firm for Non Profits can do this a lot cheaper than that:  https://www.lfnp.com/
They set up my non-profit, and helped redo the ESIP non-profit.




 
Note that, as Gary McDowell clarified, if proposal No. 3 is selected, Ronin/IGDORE-US members can also be members of the umbrella IGDORE organisation. (Evan) 




AG5. Setting up structures for the long term
Bylaws or articles of governance should ensure ultimate accountability[ai][aj][ak] to the scholars. This could include:
* Annual General Meetings (AGMs), to include reports on a) accounts and other financial matters, b) membership (scholars), c) IT matters. Scholars to be treated as members with voting rights at AGM.
* Accountability mechanisms for IT administrators/safeguards against misuse.
* Ensuring all scholars have access to all meeting papers of the Board (a right currently given to “members” in the Bylaws, Section 4 c)).


It could be helpful to Identify roles which require regular work of 0.5 FTE or more, and how we will fill these (for example, start with call for volunteers, then if still vacant, recruit). Bylaw/articles of governance should ensure that the people in these posts have necessary authorisation to fulfill these duties.

Appendix A. Resignation Letter of Ronin Board of Directors


On 2024-04-05, the Ronin Board of Directors wrote the following email:


----
Dear Ronin Scholars,
 


It is with great sadness and regret that we announce the intended resignation of the Board of Directors and the concomitant closure of the Ronin Institute.
 


We joined the Board to make a difference and serve the community. Unfortunately, we inherited many serious issues, some of which cannot be resolved. These burdens have resulted in a situation that has become untenable. 
 


We have done everything that we possibly can, having had to carry out our roles as almost full-time jobs for the last 2-3 months. Unfortunately, things have now come to a head, and continuing is no longer feasible. This is an extremely unfortunate situation, but we are unanimous that there is now no other option.
 


All things considered, knowing what we do now, it would likely have been best if the Institute had closed several months ago rather than establishing a new Board to address all the previous problems. 
 


Sincerely,
 


Dana, Cheryl, and Jens

Appendix B. Ronin Bylaws
https://web.archive.org/web/20240408161800/https://ronininstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ronin_Institute_Bylaws_2012.pdf 


Appendix C. Data Breach Email
The following email was sent from the "board of directors" email address board@ronininstitute.org on 2024-03-28 . 
Note that Arika V. refuted the claim by commenting on 2024-04-08 in this google doc "I can also assure you that it was NOT a data breach. It was a miscommunication--simply someone internally doing a back up of the system."


---
Dear Ronin Scholars,
Regrettably, the Board is writing to inform you of a data breach on the Ronin Institute server. An unauthorized download of the website, email accounts, and databases from the Ronin Institute server to a personal computer and subsequently to a private, remotely hosted server account has come to our attention. These were carried out without authorization or knowledge of the Board of Directors.
We learned only on Sunday March 25 that, for a whole month from, we believe, February 24, data from the cpanel of the Institute’s web server was backed up and downloaded onto an individual’s personal home computer. The data contained the website, its databases, and also the personal email accounts of the entire Ronin Institute membership. The individual who carried out this unauthorized activity was immediately notified to remove all data from the home computer, and any other Server, remote or otherwise, and to then send email confirmation that permanent deletion was complete. This confirmation was provided to us on March 26. A day later, on March 27, we subsequently learned by accident that these data have also been migrated to a Namecheap Hosting server account, privately owned by this individual. Until that time we had no knowledge of this, we were never informed, and the new server account cannot be accessed by the Board. Bluntly, this is a full breach of records on the Ronin Institute server.
The Board acknowledges its obligations to swiftly and directly address this matter. Accordingly, the individual concerned has been removed from their post in the Institute, appropriate authorities have been informed of this breach of personal data, and Namecheap Hosting is being informed of this activity, and that they are to delete all information related to the Ronin Institute from their servers.
All Ronin Scholars must realize that these data are not only personal (e.g. private Email addresses) but may also include personal financial information, contracts, including government contracts, connections with government projects and agencies, and details of (federal) grants that are confidential, and may also be sensitive in nature. In addition, administrative email accounts include company data such as invoices, payroll, retirement, and financial accounting. Simply put, this unknown and unauthorized download from the Institute server to personal or other computers/devices/servers in any form whatsoever, should not have taken place. We have been assured (March 28) that all the data have been deleted. Having said this, since this Board has no access to the private computer, or hosting server with the clone of the Institute website and database, we cannot say what may have been done with the data, nor whether access/permission has been given for others to make copies of the data as well.
Please be patient as we await word from authorities on how to proceed. We will keep you informed as we learn more.
Respectfully,
Dana, Cheryl, Jens
-        The Board of Directors
Appendix C1. Scholar discussion about data breach
Please see comments in Slack about the data breach, also copied below for convenience, or in the event Slack goes away unexpectedly…


Actually it was never hacked and there was no real data breach.  The board didn't understand that there wasn't enough disk space on Ronin systems to run a backup and the volunteer who had been doing that made a backup on his own system and went out and got a new server space off his machine to hold it until Ronin could get a bigger disk space; but when he told the Board that, rather than thanking him they sent out that ridiculous email and canned him.


So of course, there is no one maintaining the infrastructure at the moment.  And how you even can fire someone who is volunteering, especially when there are no standard operating procedures and one of the very first rules of conduct for Ronin is to "Act in Good Faith and Assume Good Faith from Others" I do not know; but the moment I saw that email, I knew the organization was probably dead.


On the other hand, given that he followed their instructions to delete stuff off his machine, etc. the only data breach I can think of is that it isn't clear to me that the Board has a clue how to manage the main copy of the data on the Ronin servers, especially now that they all have resigned...  Now that is very, very concerning (speaking as someone who has run several grants and contracts through Ronin).




Appendix D: Ronin Institute most recent Tax Returns?
Form 990s filed with the IRS can be looked up online at https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/details/. The EIN for the Ronin Institute is 45-4524080 and can be used for unambiguous lookup.The most recent form 990 available in this way is for tax year 2021, meaning the form 990 for 2022 is not yet posted. However, according to Laurel Haak “tax filings were in order” as of January 2024, and the latest filing was in process at the time, suggesting that the 990 form for 2022 had either been filed or was in the process of being filed at that time.


I (Nick Jackson) am not familiar with financial aspects of a 501c3 but I note that the last tax return listed is in 2021 (for the 2020 tax year). My reading is that not filing a return for three consecutive years leads to revocation of tax exempt status. https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/454524080_202109_990_2022082920302841.pdf
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/automatic-revocation-how-to-have-your-tax-exempt-status-reinstated


Arika: I’m pretty sure that taxes were filed in 2022, since an extensive financial audit was conducted during that year, so that would have covered tax year 2021. Nick: I see that as well, and that is good news.  I grabbed information from here, and it is listed as Tax year 2021 (dated August 15, 2022): https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/details/

[b]For those of us who may be a little rusty in our Latin language skills....according to Google Translate, this is "we hope in truth"
[c]@daniel please add your motto and then we can test the voting tool <g> use google translate to create the one you like
[d]Editors: I would like to suggest that for this document, you try to separate out "what exists today" (scoping out the problem) from "proposed solutions". We really need to understand what we are working with (what is the problem/what are the facts) before being able to propose any solutions.

[i]Jorrit and I are happy to host a workshop to teamwork on action items from this document. What about April 22, i.e. two weeks after this document was started? Would that be too late or too early or kinda OK? Should it be 1h or something longer?
[j]I am traveling April 22.
[k]Daniel please join the google group and invite others if you like, please have one or more dates in one or omre timezones so that we can all manage to participate
[l]@Daniel suggest to put out a doodle poll (or similar) with reasonable deadline (Monday 15 April?) and broadcast across slack, discord, and google groups.
[m]Great idea btw!
[n]What is meant by "open" here? Typically, an open letter is one that is published or is otherwise visible to the public, i.e. not just to the recipient. Is that what you mean? Or do you mean a letter that all members can sign? In which case I wouldn't call it an open letter.
[o]Thanks for asking Patricia. I'd say that an open letter is a publicly available letter typically addressed to someone or some group (like  the Ronin Board). Members are invited to contribute/sign this open letter. Example of open letter see : https://pepperluboff.wordpress.com/2017/01/21/an-open-letter-to-jack-dorsey/ .

[p]For those that have asked...and anyone else interested, there is an 8 minute Loomio demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itXYid8eSiI&list=PLfeqYbxvuD2-yKR3Ghtq3hVachzUDx_yM


We use Loomio for EarthArXiv discussions and governance. We have several different groups, all independent of each other, and use threads to discuss topics. There is polling functionality.  All content persists.  


However, it is a paid service.  For less than 100 members, a lifetime account is a one off payment of $200 USD.  (I'm not sure how many *active* Ronins there are; I'm quite new)


I find it useful, but it is a completely separate service (contained) and it is entirely possible Slido or Google Foms meets the requirements of the group.
[q]To me, a platform serves a similar purpose well is preferable over a "free" (as in sell your data for $0) platform that is not built specifically for a purpose. Disclaimer: I am one of those people that *pays* for a personal email service.


Any chance we get join an existing one for the time being to do initial voting/ decision making? Like a working group of EarthArXiv ?
[r]This is true for many non-profits. This is probably why they are reacting so strongly. They can be sued personally.
[s]Yes, and why I raised the question earlier whether and what level of insurance Ronin has for its Directors.
[t]Please add your valuable insights and comments to the text if you have the time/desire.
[u]I thought the statements that were there said it already, but I've made an attempt at rephrasing it so it's perhaps clearer.
[v]+1  Would love to help with this!
[w]I think this is a great idea and would be greatly helped by Laurel's expertise!!!
[x]Thanks Laure!!
[y]Awesome! Is that an action item to record? Something like "explore options and estimate work needed to form a new nonprofit cooperative. Perhaps model after successful ones?
[z]+1 if absolutely necessary (I am very interested in Alex's thoughts as well on this). I have much significant recent scholarship  which I have proudly associated with the Ronin name and our community. Losing that identification would be quite unfortunate. Especially with communities built on identification with ideals such as ours (rather than revenue or other material assets, for example), not having the symbols and name associated with that identity is a major loss.
[aa]+1 here too!
[ab]+1 - I'm sure we don't want to lose the branding, but it might be cheaper to just walk away than hire an attorney to look at the aftermath. A good test might be to see if Ronin as it is now could get D&O insurance coverage.
[ac]I actually think that we are in a great place to ask for funding to seed a new nonprofit: A Scholars Cooperative. Having a community in place is often one of the biggest obstacles for applying for funding that is intended to support a large group of people. I've often seen proposals where a group is like: We're going to start a community in the first year! And it's obvious to me that it's going to take years to pull the community together--and the community may be a fail anyway (the value proposition isn't strong enough). And we already have that!

[ad]Sounds promising. @Nick J: Would it help if "Ronin" appeared somewhere in the name of the new organization? E.g. "The New Ronin Collaborative" or something? Or does it really need to be the same entity?
[ae]@Patricia I think that might help.  I am imagining what folks would think as they look at journal articles or other materials, see the Ronin Institute affiliation, and find no evidence that the institution exists.  I also recognize that this might be moot depending on what information the board has that determined their rapid and definitive decision. Also, @Arika, you make a wonderful point that regardless of the organizational issues we have an engaged community of scholars right now, which could contribute to establishing a new institution or a defined group within an existing institution.
[af]Thanks for sharing your thoughts on forming a new entity. I'd like to invite your to formulate action items and assign leads if you'd like to move this discussion forward.
[ag]I took a note of these comments. We probably need to wait for the dissolution of Ronin before we can  move on any of these things. OR we need to leave Ronin voluntarily and get started!
[ah]So this comment thread can be closed.
[ai]These mechanisms would require attention and involvement from the members.  My impression is that, at present, many members are not very actively involved. Perhaps  active participation of some kind, e.g. voting or volunteering, should be a requirement for membership in future.

[aj]I proposed this to Jon and others,  when I joined. I was surprised hat members dont have to do anything to stay members forever, even a small minimal commitment.  A blog post, an article, a talk, doing some routine admin tasks etc
[ak]Please add suggestion to the text if you'd like to include them.
