________________
[1] The initial  bylaws of RIIS were created by a core group of volunteers beginning in June, 2024. Using a combination of old Ronin Institute documents and new reference material such as Local Contexts they created a new set of bylaws with a focus on correcting the perceived flaws in the previous organization. Founding principles include inclusivity, academic freedom, and accountability. The project was a collective community based effort and the core members of the bylaws working group included Ruth Duerr, Jovita De Loatch, Elena Fujiwara, Rami Saydjari and Carolyn Seaflon. Additional contributors included Allan Tameshtit, Keith Tse, Herbert Bernstein, Arika Virapongse, Alex Lancaster, Laure Haak.


[2] The bylaws shall be reviewed from time to time as needed but no less often than every 2 years.
