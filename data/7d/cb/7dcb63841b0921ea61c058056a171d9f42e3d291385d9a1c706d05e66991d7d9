This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.
Section 2 — Definitions:
a. Interested Person. Any director, principal officer, member of a committee with governing board delegated powers, or any other person who is a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4958(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and as amplified by Section 53.4958-3 of the IRS Regulations, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.

3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.
Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.
A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Section 3, paragraph B, a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

a. Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
b. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.
c. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.
The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.
After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether the corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is ni the corporation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
d. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
If, after hearing the member's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
Section 4 — Annual Statements:
Each director, principal officer, and member of a committee with governing board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms: 
a. The person has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy; 
b. The person has read and understands the policy;
c. The person has agreed to comply with the policy; and
d. The person understands the corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.
Section 5 — Periodic Reviews:
To ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:
a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining.
b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in insurance, impermissible private benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.

[a]Do we like this name? Do we need to change it?
[b]Ronin works for me. We have a rich citation history under Ronin, I think it is worth keeping for that reason. I have no other attachment to it. Always open to other ideas!
[c]Are there any other aspects we need to mention?
[d]This address will change at some point
[e]We need to ensure that this is high enough to fund needed infrastructure and to discourage folks who aren't really interested in scholarship.


Also, we briefly discussed a dues scale based on the average hourly academic wage for the country the person is in - rather than a flat fee which would discriminate against folks from other countries.  


Is 5 hours of volunteer work enough?  How about 12 or 24 (1-2 hours per month?)
[f]What about termination for cause?  Example, unacceptable behavior.  Do you really want potentially 400 people to have to weigh in on whether a case of sexual harassment occurred or not?
[g]I think the board should have the ability to terminate memberships for cause. That and a way for the members to terminate / replace the board by majority vote (with quorum) would have some checks and balances.
[h]in addition, we'd want to keep an archive of meeting notes. Optionally with closed sections for confidential stuff.
[i]what is the minimum quorum?
[j]Any minimum size constraints?  So if a meeting is properly called (but takes place when say only people from Guam are likely to show up) and only 1 person comes, that person can change the whole organization!
[k]Really?  About the time they get up to speed on what their responsibilities are they get need to get re-elected in order to use that knowledge?  I suggest at least a 2 year term.


I note that the American Geophysical Union had this issue and about 10 years ago changed to a sort of 6 year cycle, where the first two years you were the president-elect of your group (mine was Earth and Space Science Informatics - so I was president in training for 2 years); then two years as president, followed by 2 years as past-President where you were to train those who followed you).  I think this resulted in a more informed and responsive board.  I think the time frame is probably too long for Ronin but ...?
[l]New Jersey?  What about other cultures?
[m]Should the title be executive director?  I think that is the function being performed here.
[n]forbidden?  We need firm procedures around these capabilities....
[o]Actually, shouldn't these be publicly available along with the by-laws and procedures?
[p]Actually I think it is necessary to see a treasurers report at every board meeting.
[q]I think the members should have a way to oust / replace the board also.
[r]Really?
