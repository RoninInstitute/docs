ARTICLE I — NAME AND PURPOSE
Section 1 — Name: 
The name of the organization shall be the Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship (“RIIS”) 2.0. It shall be a nonprofit organization incorporated under the laws of the State of California.
Section 2 — IRC Section 501(c)(3) Purposes:  
RIIS is organized exclusively for charitable, scholarly, scientific, and educational purposes. The specific objectives and purposes are to support and facilitate the execution and dissemination of scholarly research in the public interest. RIIS offers scholars committed to truth and empathy an inclusive academic community to share ideas and grow intellectually, to improve and develop their capabilities, and to help scholars establish new contacts and collaborations. RIIS is a platform outside of traditional academia that invites marginalized scholars worldwide and those with unique perspectives to share their voices and address issues in their purview, fostering opportunities for unique academic insights. Scholars with a broad diversity of experiences can contribute to scientific research for public benefit within the environment of independent scholarship that RIIS provides. 
Section 3: RIIS Values And Principles
Subsection 1. Values: Truth and Empathy
Scholars (both Fellows and Associates) shall read and understand our Founding Values of truth and empathy, and abide by the specific policies that flow from those values. 
Scholars from all disciplines shall seek truths in pursuant to a better understanding of our world. Scholars pursue their research in the way that works best for them. We expect that scholars will be honest and thoughtful, both in scholarship and in their interactions with the community and world at large.
Empathy demands that one act in good faith and assume good faith from others. RIIS expects Fellows to interact in a spirit of kindness, generosity, and patience. We are a highly interdisciplinary and international community with Fellows who may have very different perspectives and backgrounds.
Subsection 2. Nondiscrimination
RIIS and its officers, Councilors, employees, and persons served by RIIS shall be selected in a non-discriminatory manner with respect to race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status such as disability, age, marital and family status, sexual orientation and gender identity, health status, place of residence, and economic and social situation. 
Subsection 3. Belonging
RIIS and its Council are also committed to incorporating the values of our Belonging Policy in the governance and operations of this Institute. RIIS believes everyone has the right to work in a professional environment where their knowledge, skills, and abilities are the factors for their success. RIIS expects all Fellows to maintain standards of propriety, treat everyone professionally, and act without bias. RIIS has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. These values shall be adopted by the Fellows and Associates and be codified in a Belonging Policy adopted by the Council.
RIIS acknowledges the values expressed in the Belonging Policy as foundational principles of the Institute. RIIS seeks to expand the academic landscape by providing a heterogeneous body of scholars with equitable access to opportunities, resources, and support. 
ARTICLE II — FELLOWSHIP
Section 1 — Definition
A Fellow must fulfill membership requirements as outlined below and in the Policies and Procedures documentation. Someone who doesn’t qualify as a Fellow may qualify as an Associate (see Article VI).  Both Fellows and Associates are considered to be members of RIIS.
Section 2 — Eligibility for Fellowship:  
Details are included in the Membership Policy, to be considered for membership, an applicant must demonstrate academic achievement and scholarly commitment equivalent to at least one year of study at an accredited university. The determination of such equivalency shall be at the discretion of the Fellowship Working Group and ultimately, the approval of the Governing Council. Application for membership shall be open to any scholar in pursuit of academic scholarship. All Fellows agree to follow the code of conduct and ethics. Fellowship is granted after completion and receipt of a membership application, payment of annual dues, and recommendation to the Council by the Fellowship Working Group. The Council shall oversee the membership enrollment process. 
Section 3 — Annual dues:  
Dues may consist of a combination of an annual monetary fee and a number of volunteer hours, equitably determined by the Council (and may vary among Fellows based on means). Continued membership is contingent upon being up-to-date on membership dues. Procedures for determining dues will be defined within the Policies and Procedures document, with any changes approved by a vote of the membership. A copy of the current dues will be available on the website.
Section 4 — Rights of Fellows: 
Fellowship shall entitle Fellows to (i) participate in the programs of the RIIS; (ii) have the right to vote on the election or removal of Councilors, on the disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation, on any merger and its principal terms and any amendment of those terms, and on any election to dissolve the corporation, and to participate in any votes put to the membership by the Council; and (iii) to request RIIS to administer the Fellow’s awards, grants and contracts.
Section 5 — Resignation and Termination:  
Subsection  5.1 Resignation:
Any Fellow may resign by submitting  a  resignation via a process overseen by the secretary. Resignation shall not relieve a Fellow of any dues previously accrued. 
Subsection  5.2 Termination:
The Policy and Procedures for termination shall govern termination of membership. 
ARTICLE III — NOTICES 
All meeting Notices shall be sent out by the Secretary or their designate. Notice of Fellows' meetings shall be sent not less than 1) one month prior to the Annual Meeting, 2) two weeks prior to a Special Meeting, and 3) two weeks in advance of a Council meeting.   
ARTICLE IV — MEETINGS OF FELLOWS
Section 1 — Annual meetings: 
A regular virtual meeting of the Fellows shall take place annually. The specific date, time, and virtual location of which will be designated by the Council. At the annual meeting, the Fellows shall elect Councilors and Officers, receive reports on the activities of the association, and determine the direction of the association for the coming year.

See the Policies and Procedures for criteria for what decisions need to be voted on and by what groups.
Section 4 — Rules of Order:

ARTICLE V — ELECTRONIC MEETINGS
All Fellow, Council, and Working Group meetings shall be conducted through the use of Internet meeting services that support the meeting Policies and Procedures.
ARTICLE VI — NON-VOTING ASSOCIATES
Section 1 — Justification
To allow scholars to be associated with the Institute who are not in a position to commit either time or money to membership, the Fellowship may admit non-voting Associates to use the Institute affiliation and participate in non-voting aspects of the community.
Section 2 — Process and Role
To become an Associate, an application must be filed similar to that for membership as Fellows. The requirements to be an Associate are the same as those of Fellows, except that Associates do not need to pay full dues. Associates are bound by the same code of conduct as Fellows.
Associates may attend but not vote nor participate in Council meetings and may attend but not vote at Fellowship meetings. However, they may attend and participate in working-group meetings, other meetings and seminars, and online forums.
Section 3 — Resignation
Any Associate may resign or have their association terminated by the same process as Fellows. 
ARTICLE VII — GOVERNING BODY
Section 1 — Council role, size, and compensation:  
The Council is the governing body of the Institute. It is responsible for the execution of the overall policy and direction of the association and may delegate responsibility for day-to-day operations to staff and working groups. The Council shall have up to fifteen (15), but no fewer than six (6) Fellows. 
If the number of elected Councilors on the Governing Council falls below the required minimum, the following procedures should be followed:
1. Temporary Suspension of Certain Decisions: If quorum requirements are not met due to the shortage of elected Councilors, no major decisions (such as bylaw amendments or financial commitments) may be made until the minimum number of Council members is restored.
2. Emergency Appointment Process: The remaining Council members may appoint interim members to fill vacancies until a formal election can be conducted. These appointments must be ratified by the Council through the established voting process.
3. Special Election: A special election must be called within 30 days to fill the vacant positions and restore the Council to its minimum required size.
4. Escalation Procedures: If the Council cannot be restored within the designated time frame, governance responsibilities may temporarily be transferred to an appointed working group or an advisory board until new Council members are elected.
The Council shall be empowered to appoint Officers with duties described in Section 6.
Section 2 — Terms: 
Elected Councilors will serve for 36 months, with the term beginning at the annual meeting during or immediately following their election. At least one-third (1/3) of the Council (at least 2 Councilors) shall be renewed every 12 months (i.e. terms are staggered). Nominations for incoming Councilors shall take place within the twelve months prior to the upcoming annual meeting. Voting for nominated Councilors shall take place in the immediate 6 months prior to the upcoming annual meeting.
As Councilors may be re-elected, there is no term limit on serving as a Councilor.
Section 3 — Qualifications and Election Procedures: 
Any Fellow may nominate another Fellow, who has been a Fellow for a minimum of a year or has played a leadership role in a comparable organization as deemed by the Council as a candidate to the slate of nominees for the Council. Nominees shall be of the age of majority in their home jurisdiction, such as state, province, or country of residence. 
Nominations will be collected by a Volunteer Coordination Working Group, which will help ensure strong candidates for every Officer role, with an effort to nominate Fellows from diverse continents, fields of study, and demographics.
Section 4 — Council Elections: 
Councilors shall be elected by the Fellows following the Annual Meeting. Councilors will be elected by the Fellows as specified in the Policy on Elections.

The Volunteer Coordination Working Group shall issue a call for Councilor candidates at least 120 days ahead of the elections. The Volunteer Coordination Working Group shall interview candidates and develop a slate based on the representation considerations in the Belonging and Volunteer Coordination Policies and Procedures, for Council review and approval.
Elections are by a majority vote of the Fellows on a slate presented by the Volunteer Coordination Working Group following approval by the Council. Write-in candidates may be nominated by any group of 20 or more Fellows no more than 30 days after the slate is announced. If write-in candidates are received, elections are conducted using the same voting methodology among the slate and any write-in candidates, as specified in the Elections Policy.
For the first election, one-third of the Councilors shall hold office for 3 years, one-third for 2 years, and the remaining third for one year. Thereafter, each newly elected Councilor shall serve 3 years.

4. Meet at such times and places as required by these bylaws; The Council shall meet regularly three times annually or approximately every 3-to 4 months.

Section 6 — Councilor Roles and Specific Duties: 
There shall be at least four Officers on the Council, consisting of a Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and Past Chair. Other Officers may be appointed by the Council as needed. 
Officers are elected from among current Councilors by the Council every year and serve 1-year terms in their role but may be re-appointed by the Council. There is a 3-year term limit to serve as Chair. A Past Chair may serve another term as Chair after three (3) years of not serving as Chair.
In addition to the duties below, the Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer are each responsible for mentoring at least one (preferably two) newer Councilors (starting in the first year of their term) to be prepared to fulfill their respective Officer duties, such as in case of illness of the Officer or at the end of the Officer’s term. There should never be only one Councilor with the knowledge or access to fulfill any Officer duty.
For the second Council and thereafter, each newly-elected Councilor is responsible for serving as an apprentice in the first year of their term to one of the key Officers (the Chair, Secretary, or Treasurer), such that they can assist with that role and could assume that role if needed in the future. An apprentice does not automatically become an Officer when the position opens but rather needs to be elected as described in this section. No Councilor may hold more than one Officer role at a time.
Subsection 6.1 Chair
The Chair shall be responsible for convening regularly scheduled Council meetings and shall preside or arrange for another Councilor to preside at each meeting of the Council and at all meetings of the Fellows.

Subsection 6.2 Secretary

Section 7 — Consensus Decision Making: 
Meetings shall follow the Consensus Decision-making Policy and the Policy on Meetings.
Every act or decision done or made by a consensus of the Councilors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the Council.  
Section 8 — Vacancies:  
If a vacancy on the Council occurs mid-term but the total number of Councilors remains above 5, the vacancy will be filled at the next annual election. If the vacancy would reduce the number of Councilors below the minimum number, then the secretary must receive nominations for new officers. These nominations shall be voted upon at the next Fellow meeting if it will occur in less than four months, or at a special meeting to be called for the election within four months, whichever is earlier.
If there is a vacancy for an Officer position, the Council shall appoint a qualified Councilor to fill the Officer position as soon as feasible.
Section 9 — Resignation, Termination, and Absences:
Resignation from the Council must be in writing and received by the Secretary. A Council Fellow shall be terminated from the Council due to more than two unexcused absences from Council meetings in a year. An excused absence shall be one approved by at least one other Councilor prior to the absence or by a majority of the Council after the absence. A Councilor may be removed for other reasons by the other Councilors acting by Consensus at a duly convened Council meeting, provided that written notice of the intention to consider removal of the Councilor has been included in the notice of the meeting. No Councilor shall be removed without having the opportunity to be heard at such a meeting, but no formal hearing procedure needs to be followed.
A Councilor may also be removed by a vote of the Fellows, following the Procedures for voting and communications, which results in a two-thirds or higher vote of no confidence.
Section 10 — Compensation: 
Councilors are volunteers and may not be compensated for their services as Councilors but may be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their duties as Councilors. Councilors may be compensated for their personal and professional services rendered to or on behalf of the RIIS if approved in advance by the Council and subject to compliance with RIIS’s Conflict of Interest Policy.
Section 11 — Non-liability of Councilors: 
The Councilors shall not be personally liable for the debts, liabilities, or other obligations of the corporation, as limited under the laws of the State of California.

Section 4 — Conduct of Meetings: 
Meetings of the Council shall be presided over by the Chair of the Council, or, in their absence, by an Officer designated by a majority of the Councilors present at the meeting.

[1] The initial  bylaws of RIIS 2.0 were created by a core group of volunteers beginning in June, 2024. Using a combination of old Ronin Institute documents and new reference material such as Local Contexts they created a new set of bylaws with a focus on correcting the perceived flaws in the previous organization. Founding principles include inclusivity, academic freedom, and accountability. The project was a collective community based effort and the core members of the bylaws working group included Ruth Duerr, Jovita De Loatch, Elena Fujiwara, Rami Saydjari and Carolyn Seaflon. Additional contributors included Allan Tameshtit, Keith Tse, Herbert Bernstein, Arika Virapongse, Alex Lancaster, Laure Haak.
