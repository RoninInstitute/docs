About this document
(Note: see version history)


On 2024-04-05, the Ronin Board of Directors sent an email to announce their decision to dissolve the Ronin Institute, along with their intention to resign.  With this document, we'd like to collaborate with fellow Ronin Scholars (G0) to explore how to (G1) retain the community, (G2) retain the services, (G3) do a retrospective of what led to the resignation (G4) formulate a short/long term plan to foster independent scholarship. For things not fitting this structure, there is the Open Space section.


The overall goal is to make an effort to connect and share ideas on what is next for those associated with Ronin Institute.

Open Questions
Tier 1
* What issues have caused the Board to decide that dissolving the institute is necessary? 
* What is the current legal status of the Ronin Institute? 
* What is the current capacity of the (former?) Board of Directors? Do they still legally represent Ronin as an Institute?
* What are the available paths forward for any current Ronin facilitated grant holders?
Tier 2
* Does the dissolution resolve the issues in any way or do they persist, and if so, how?
* What was the nature of the data incident - an act of sabotage, an attempt to help or something else entirely?  (what data incident??) See Appendix C. Data Breach Email 
* What happens to the digital assets or liabilities of the Ronin Institute[a][b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i][j][k] (e.g., internet domain registration, logo copyright, taxes, bank account, outstanding grants)?
* What are alternative not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organizations that will permit you to have PI status and accept Ronin's 10% de minimis Indirect Costs or 25% overhead with NSF?
Action Items (who is working on what)
(Jorrit/Daniel, done) Propose a framework to collaborate on ways to reframe Ronin and learn from this experience.


(ongoing) Set up round of meetings, and follow the standard Ronin Governance model step by step request members to vote on decisions see also CONSENSUS GOVERNANCE PROCESS AND TOOLS.






Immediate Goal
G0. Appreciate all the work that went into Ronin - the countless hours spent on keeping the organization alive, the effort put into resolving conflict, dealing with massive amounts of paperwork, and carrying the weight of unprocessed events and miscommunication. Despite all our differences, I believe we have many things in common, especially the pursuit of independent scholarship. (I am feeling a bit cheesy now, but I think I mean it. . . ). In short - figure out how to hit the "pause" button, thank each other and reflect.


G1. Confirm with the Board their decision to resign, and[l] determine the next steps for having formal leadership in place to make crucial decisions. An “interim board”? 
* Do we need to issue an acceptance of resignation letter and get as many scholar as possible to sign it?  Also, find out who owns /controls the digital resources (entered a to do item in the consensus doc)
* 



G2. Understand what the scope of the problem is. Host a listening session with the current board and any former Advisory Board members who are willing to attend. [m][n][o][p]
G1. Organize ourselves (highest priority), decide a governance structure and process, document the process 
G1. Follow  Consensus Model for Decision Making (see also https://www.sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/)
  



* Establish communication channels 
   * candidates: 
      * Slack https://app.slack.com/client/T0990TU4V
      * Discord (a dedicated discord server is available at https://discord.gg/hEZNGvVV ) 
      * Google Group started on April 7th  please join!
* (inspired by Paola/Brandon/Evangelos comment thread) Create Voter Roll (who can vote? how to register to vote?) and establish a method to create, distribute, and publish resolutions to vote on.
      * Use Loomio? 
      * Use slido?[q][r][s]   
      * Google Forms — 100% free survey tool.
      * SurveyPlanet — Best for unlimited question types and responses.
      * Who volunteers to be the vote facilitator? 
         * (Paola) have Governance WG facilitate voting for the time being. 
It is not just a question of voting, it is a question of setting up a consensus governance process that members can be part of . Voting is part of a governance mechanism that has been missing from Ronin Institute (there was an intention of having it was never implemented) Here is a doc containing a suggested way to to about it, please contribute by asking edit access (so that only logged in editors can make edits)
* * Set up an organizational structure, formulate and distribute tasks 
   * Who's doing what? 
   * What needs to be done?
      * Are there any legal obligations that need attention?
         * by Ronin as an organization[t][u]
         * by individual Ronin Scholars
Additional Goals
G1. Retaining community 
How can we make sure that Ronins can stay in touch ?
Answer 1: By joining the Google group that was started when slack was down
* Answer 4: Linkedin
G2. Retaining services 
Here are the services that the Ronin Institute provides: 
1. Sponsored Research Office
2. Human Subjects Research ethics review (via Rutgers U.[v][w][x][y][z][aa][ab])
   1. History (from Arika): Exempt review was offered at Ronin without a cost to membership for about a year up until March 2023 (I was the HSR chair who did these exemptions), but it was a cost to Ronin and only provided benefits to the few people who used it. The easiest route here is to just pay Rutgers to do the reviews (Ronin still has this relationship with Rutgers active). 
   2. Opportunity: We charge a service fee (sliding scale?) for doing/managing these exempt reviews. 
3. Affiliation and membership (via the website). This affiliation has allowed members to obtain discounts on software and physical library access. 
   1. Current status: Website is owned by Jon Wilkins (previous Ronin Institute President). Admin is Dana Cohen and possibly others. ronininstitute.org
   2. Communication with each other and self-organization (via Slack)
4. Promoting the successes of our membership (via Newsletter and social media)
5. An email account for each member.


G3. Retrospective
 (what led up to the board’s decision to dissolve) 
What led to Jon Wilkins and Arika to suddenly resign in 2023?)
G4. Formulating long/short term plans to continue to foster independent scholarship.
(existing or proposed plans to continue to foster independent scholarship)


[please feel free to add additional goals or reformulate existing ones]...


Here are some proposals that has come up so far (contributed by Arika):
1. Nick Halper, Executive Director of Neuromatch Inc. offers fiscal sponsorship or helping post-Ronin navigate starting a new non-profit
2. Merc Fox, Executive Director from CODATA offers to host the Ronin Institute to help preserve the current grants.
3. Gavin Taylor (global board member) and Rebecca Willen (founder) from IGDORE propose that Ronin becomes a US-IGDORE arm or an institutional affiliate, and they may be able to help provide some basic resources to help get us started. [ac][ad]
4. Arika Virapongse (and possibly Alex Lancaster) proposes that the Ronin Institute becomes a new nonprofit cooperative (with an entirely new name and branding) that initially aims to preserve/prioritize the community and stabilize the infrastructure/governance, while using fiscal sponsorship to stabilize the existing 
Grants. The formation of a new company was  proposed by Paola Di Maio in an email to all on 5th of March
5. …
If proposal No. 4 is finally selected, we will probably need to apply for a new 501(c)(3) legal status(?). It was mentioned at Discord that a sum of $25-$30k or more will be needed. How do [ae][af][ag][ah][ai][aj][ak][al][am][an][ao][ap][aq][ar][as][at][au][av][aw]we plan to raise this initial amount? 
* Crowdfunding? (This could use a popular crowdfunding platform, and could include a one-off appeal to members and the wider public. In the longer term, it could be used for regular appeals, sponsored events, etc.)
* Philanthropic funding?  (We could make contact with other organisations which receive funding from foundations etc and learn what works from them. Ronin’s aims and ethos could be a good match for many foundations. However, they may have their own criteria for governance of recipients.)
* Possible member contributions?


The Law Firm for Non Profits can do this a lot cheaper than that:  


https://www.lfnp.com/


They set up my non-profit, and helped redo the ESIP non-profit.






If it has been two years since the last form 990 was submitted (Appendix D), then a question arises as to whether a new organisation, if one is to be formed, can use assets of the old Ronin Institute. (I suppose not.)
 
Note that, as Gary McDowell clarified, if proposal No. 3 is selected, Ronin/IGDORE US members can also be members of the umbrella IGDORE organisation. (Evan)

Appendix A. Resignation Letter of Ronin Board of Directors


On 2024-04-05, the Ronin Board of Directors wrote the following email:


----
Dear Ronin Scholars,
 


It is with great sadness and regret that we announce the intended resignation of the Board of Directors and the concomitant closure of the Ronin Institute.
 


We joined the Board to make a difference and serve the community. Unfortunately, we inherited many serious issues, some of which cannot be resolved. These burdens have resulted in a situation that has become untenable. 
 


We have done everything that we possibly can, having had to carry out our roles as almost full-time jobs for the last 2-3 months. Unfortunately, things have now come to a head, and continuing is no longer feasible. This is an extremely unfortunate situation, but we are unanimous that there is now no other option.
 


All things considered, knowing what we do now, it would likely have been best if the Institute had closed several months ago rather than establishing a new Board to address all the previous problems. 
 


Sincerely,
 


Dana, Cheryl, and Jens

Appendix B. Ronin Bylaws
https://web.archive.org/web/20240408161800/https://ronininstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ronin_Institute_Bylaws_2012.pdf 


Appendix C. Data Breach Email
The following email was sent from the "board of directors" email address board@ronininstitute.org on 2024-03-28 . 
Note that Arika V. refuted the claim by commenting on 2024-04-08 in this google doc "I can also assure you that it was NOT a data breach. It was a miscommunication--simply someone internally doing a back up of the system."


---
Dear Ronin Scholars,
Regrettably, the Board is writing to inform you of a data breach on the Ronin Institute server. An unauthorized download of the website, email accounts, and databases from the Ronin Institute server to a personal computer and subsequently to a private, remotely hosted server account has come to our attention. These were carried out without authorization or knowledge of the Board of Directors.
We learned only on Sunday March 25 that, for a whole month from, we believe, February 24, data from the cpanel of the Institute’s web server was backed up and downloaded onto an individual’s personal home computer. The data contained the website, its databases, and also the personal email accounts of the entire Ronin Institute membership. The individual who carried out this unauthorized activity was immediately notified to remove all data from the home computer, and any other Server, remote or otherwise, and to then send email confirmation that permanent deletion was complete. This confirmation was provided to us on March 26. A day later, on March 27, we subsequently learned by accident that these data have also been migrated to a Namecheap Hosting server account, privately owned by this individual. Until that time we had no knowledge of this, we were never informed, and the new server account cannot be accessed by the Board. Bluntly, this is a full breach of records on the Ronin Institute server.
The Board acknowledges its obligations to swiftly and directly address this matter. Accordingly, the individual concerned has been removed from their post in the Institute, appropriate authorities have been informed of this breach of personal data, and Namecheap Hosting is being informed of this activity, and that they are to delete all information related to the Ronin Institute from their servers.
All Ronin Scholars must realize that these data are not only personal (e.g. private Email addresses) but may also include personal financial information, contracts, including government contracts, connections with government projects and agencies, and details of (federal) grants that are confidential, and may also be sensitive in nature. In addition, administrative email accounts include company data such as invoices, payroll, retirement, and financial accounting. Simply put, this unknown and unauthorized download from the Institute server to personal or other computers/devices/servers in any form whatsoever, should not have taken place. We have been assured (March 28) that all the data have been deleted. Having said this, since this Board has no access to the private computer, or hosting server with the clone of the Institute website and database, we cannot say what may have been done with the data, nor whether access/permission has been given for others to make copies of the data as well.
Please be patient as we await word from authorities on how to proceed. We will keep you informed as we learn more.
Respectfully,
Dana, Cheryl, Jens
-        The Board of Directors
Appendix C1. Scholar discussion about data breach
Please see comments in Slack about the data breach, also copied below for convenience, or in the event Slack goes away unexpectedly…[ax][ay][az]


Actually it was never hacked and there was no real data breach.  The board didn't understand that there wasn't enough disk space on Ronin systems to run a backup and the volunteer who had been doing that made a backup on his own system and went out and got a new server space off his machine to hold it until Ronin could get a bigger disk space; but when he told the Board that, rather than thanking him they sent out that ridiculous email and canned him.


So of course, there is no one maintaining the infrastructure at the moment.  And how you even can fire someone who is volunteering, especially when there are no standard operating procedures and one of the very first rules of conduct for Ronin is to "Act in Good Faith and Assume Good Faith from Others" I do not know; but the moment I saw that email, I knew the organization was probably dead.


On the other hand, given that he followed their instructions to delete stuff off his machine, etc. the only data breach I can think of is that it isn't clear to me that the Board has a clue how to manage the main copy of the data on the Ronin servers, especially now that they all have resigned...  Now that is very, very concerning (speaking as someone who has run several grants and contracts through Ronin).




Appendix D: Ronin Institute most recent Tax Returns?
I (Nick Jackson) am not familiar with financial aspects of a 501c3 but I note that the last tax return listed is in 2021 (for the 2020 tax year). My reading is that not filing a return for three consecutive years leads to revocation of tax exempt status. https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/454524080_202109_990_2022082920302841.pdf
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/automatic-revocation-how-to-have-your-tax-exempt-status-reinstated


Arika: I’m pretty sure that taxes were filed in 2022, since a pretty extensive financial audit was conducted during that year, so that would have covered tax year 2021. Nick: I see that as well, and that is good news.  I grabbed information from here, and it is listed as Tax year 2021 (dated August 15, 2022): https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/details/

[a]The "Ronin" name has real value given how long it has been used by many of us. If it is possible (and we may learn that it is not possible), it would be great if we could retain that name going forward. Also, nice to have would be the logo and domain name, but less important IMO.
[b]+1 - and I for one have been proud to use it and would hate to have to give it up!!!
[c]+1 from me too.
[d]I also appreciate the "Ronin" name and hope to continue to use it whenever we can. I think that the strength of an organization is in its ability to deal with unforeseen circumstance, come together, and figure stuff out. And this is what is happening here!
[e]I agree!  Ronin and the symbol logo have been my consistent institutional identity, and changing  would be a significant loss.
[f]I agree as well, it seems that the organisation is crossing the Rubicon. Ronin name is in many academic data base from different disciplines.
[g]Ronin Institute lives then, who owns the domain name?
[h]@Paola: Jon Wilkins?
[i]strongly agree about the value of the name and logo. In the worst case, if RI had to change names, could be variant thereof. For instance, "Sylvester the Cat Institute" could become "Sylvester the Cat and Associates Institute".
[j]So far I've heard "Ronin in Exile" and "The Ronin Phoenix" as future names...  Either works for me...
[k]How 'bout "The Institute formerly known as Ronin." ; )
[l]Since the board has been acting irrationally , it goes without saying that they are not fit , There is no need to confirm anything with them anymore, just get them to hand over the keys back to the interim board (Nick J proposal)
[m]According to the Ronin Bylaws, do we have a current board?  I think there may be consensus that the "dissolution" email went against many of our bylaws as well as State of New Jersey regulations in proclaiming "Ronin" to be closed.  However, I would support the  stated resignations of the board members.  Therefore, might one of our first orders of business be to (s)elect at least one interim board member and proceed as members with making the short-term decisions necessary to stabilize our organization (e.g. figuring out our financial status)?
[n]Nick, I have asked the same question too. It's the 4th bullet of the "Open Questions", Tier 1 list.
[o]Yes Nick, I think many here agree with you that the board was not following the legal procedure, perhaps you could advise us as to what would be the situation. interim board could be good.  are you local to NJ? is jon still up for using the address in NJ?  I ll try to add you to the governance doc as editor.  are you stepping forward to lead the interim board? are ou on the google group?
[p]I cannot find anything in the bylaws that would disallow the Board from dissolving the 501(c)3 entity and to then resign at the very end, which I understood from the letter is their current plan. The bylaws expressly state that the Board has full power to conduct any and all business and operations of the organization. The current Board has not resigned, and presumably they won't resign until the entity is dissolved.
[q]Does anyone know if slido persistent?  IMO, being able to refer back to previous votes and their associated discussion would be useful thing.
[r]Brandon, here is what it says on their website: "A poll can remain active forever if you share your event with your participants via a permanent link."
[s]It is good practice to a) validate the result (have a pool of people who check the results are valid b) retain/download a copy of each voter result c) lodge the copy of the result witha  trusted party-just in case things fall apart
[t]The answer is presumably yes, but there isn't anybody other than the current Board who is empowered to address them.
[u]The board may have to respond to NSF (the funders) and or a federal judge if some law has been broken. Surely someone must have noticed if legal breaches may have occurred?
[v]Just noting here that it looked like (from some of the previous documents) that HSR review for projects that were likely to be exempt didn't have to be escalated to Rutgers. That would be ideal in the future if Ronin/its successor is able to offer something like that again, since the fees can still be too much for many.
[w]Exempt review was offered at Ronin without a cost to membership (I was the HSR chair), but it was a cost to Ronin and only provided benefits to the few people who used it. The easiest route here is to just pay Rutgers to do the reviews, and if we want to do it internally, then we charge a service fee. Doing too many things for free is what got Ronin into this mess in the first place. (Hopefully that doesn't sound too harsh, but at this point, I think we need to be very realistic about how to move forward).
[x]Thanks! That's helpful to know. Unfortunate that many independent folks will always be gatekept out of publishing related to HSR, minus the ones who can afford the cost, but unless a better system came along I doubt there's anything to be done.
[y]Hey Courtney, Arika, Sounds like your comment contains some valuable insights and context. How do you feel about adding this to the document somehow? Do you think it would improve the document? I leave the final decision up to you.
[z]Courtney and Arika, I second Jorrit's request to add this valuable information into the document, please.
[aa]I added it already, but if you think that more detail is needed, please let me know.
[ab]Thanks Arika!
[ac]While all of these are great, I wonder if this option offers the least resistance.  Also, IGDORE's principles/bylaws seem to line up quite well with Ronin, meaning there is possibly less of a "learning curve" (or financial obligation straightaway)
[ad]Thanks for sharing your take on the IGDORE option. Would it be an idea to add this text as a "in support" subsection below the proposal?
[ae]we need to ask the member base which of these options they want to go for, document their preference (ask everyone to vote) and document the voting process. in previous rounds of decision making, the decisions were not documented and ended up being arbitrary
[af]I like your idea of vote taking . . . do you have a suggestion on how to enroll voters, announcing votes and how to keep track of their votes?
[ag]its called polling, slack has it bt not all scholars are on slack. we can set up a polling facility. but first we need a new domain, a new mail server and new email addresses so that each scholar can only give one vote
[ah]Hi Paola, I like you polling suggestion too! I'm just doing a little research on this and it seems there are free tools that use secure, QR codes. I'll try to get more info.
[ai]"Slido" seems to be one of the more popular.
[aj]there are tons of polling tools we need one that lets users be uniquely identified and save the poll results (tamper proof) ideally, that could tie in a decision making workflow. lets think atbout this, also alex may have some ideas if he is still supporting.
1 total reaction
Evangelos Roussos reacted with 👍 at 2024-04-08 12:22 PM
[ak]Loomio has served well in this regard.  Can split out topics into separate discussion(s) and there is polling functionality.   The upside is there aren't 75 thousand google docs ( :) ).  However, I don't know off the top of my head what the free tier enables...
[al]Evangelos, Paula, Brandon - would it be an idea to try some out with a test poll (e.g., Do you like eating pizza?) and see how the various tools work ? Open to other suggestions on how to move forward on a way to poll.
[am]That seems reasonable to me, Jorrit.
[an]Good morning All! Jorrit, I think it's a very good idea to test-drive a polling system.
[ao]Goodmorning everyone, I would suggest we form a test group for both the consensus governance process and the polling tool (inviting members on slack/google group who want to the part of the evaluation) Rather than bothering everyone. I once tested a tool for Ronin and the consequences were unimaginable headaches (Arika will remember that). Once we have a dozen people try to put forward a motion, having it discussed and voted upon, we can show what we have done to others and ask them to vote on the voting system they would prefer to adopt. This is how I would go about it. what does everybody think?
[ap]Good morning Paola! It's a good idea.
[aq]I much like the idea of doing a voting pilot and try out the idea. I think the WG already formed organically. I'd nominate Paola, Evangelos, and Brandon to form the group that facilitates and documents decision making also known as the Governance Group. By the way, to me, the Governance sounds so severe, is there a more casual word we can use that carries the same meaning.
[ar]Can someone other than Paola, Evangelos, and Brandon second my nomination?
[as]Thank you Jorrit, I have created a shared doc but did not enter any names, you are also an editor. Lets see if anyone wants to be part of the exercise. I ll be glad to be coordinating it. regarding the name, well governance is the word in use to refer to administration of the organisation so thats where we find all the references and info. but please suggest a better word that you may like to use, and it could be used also as a synonym.
[at]Thank you, Jorrit! Paola, you are full of energy, feel free to coordinate it, unless Brandon wants to do it. It's up to you two.
[au]Paola, could you please share a link to your document when you are ready?
[av]@Evangelos https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzzTprZQ52IIV5jF2VGod6OfGvIMwYW7N4hIbSjacDQ/edit . I've also  added the link to the action items on the top of the document. I'd be happy to volunteer for some voting cycles with a couple of suitable methods. My preference would be to be as simple as possible and avoid complex platforms that are maintained by others. Maybe switch to paper ballots ? (just kidding. . . kinda).
[aw]Thank you @Jorrit Totally agree! I think the simplest working method is the best, especially if a large number of not very technically inclined people are involved, but also for security reasons. (Ahh... the good old paper ballot days... )
[ax]yes, thanks for sharing, I cannot access Ronin slack anymore,
[ay]I am trying to cross post across discord/ google groups as much as I can.
[az]Thanks, just cross post the key points, what is really relevant to move forward, but we need to know who holds the keys to slack and the othere resources, there is a group on LInkedin. do we know who owns it? I think Keith tese posted to it.
