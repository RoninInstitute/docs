Policy and Procedure for Termination of Membership
Policy Overview:
The Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship (RIIS) values an inclusive and respectful scholarly community. Membership may be terminated due to noncompliance with RIIS's standards, policies, or other conditions specified in the bylaws. Termination may occur as a result of failure to meet eligibility requirements, nonactivity, or conduct detrimental to the Institute’s mission and values. 
Grounds for Termination:
1. Inactivity:
Members (both Fellows and Associates) who do not maintain active participation as defined in RIIS’s Bylaws and Policies Documents may have their membership terminated. This includes failure to meet volunteer or dues obligations. Activity might include participation in various virtual gatherings, meetings, working groups, voting, and participation in discussions on online platforms or email.
2. Ineligibility:
If a member no longer meets the qualifications for membership (as outlined in the eligibility criteria of the bylaws), their membership will be subject to termination.
3. Violations of Conduct:
Membership may be terminated based on the good faith determination by the Membership Working Group that a member has violated the Code of Conduct or engaged in behavior materially prejudicial to RIIS’s interests.
Termination Procedure:
1. Investigation:
Upon concerns that grounds for termination may exist, the membership Working Group shall review the circumstances and facts surrounding said grounds and report their findings to the Council 
2. Notification:
Members facing termination shall receive at least 30 days notice specifying the reasons for proposed suspension or termination. This notice will be delivered by email or registered mail to the address on record.
3. Response and Hearing:
The member has the right to respond in writing or request a hearing before the Membership Working Group or the Council of Directors, which will take place no later than five days before the proposed termination date. The hearing will allow the member to present any defense, either orally or in writing.
4. The decision by the Council:
Following the hearing or consideration of the member’s written response, the Council will determine whether termination is warranted. This decision will be based on majority approval by the Council of Directors and will be final. The decision will be communicated to the member within five days following the hearing.
5. Immediate Suspension:
In cases where a member’s actions severely violate the RIIS Code of Conduct, the Council may implement immediate suspension pending the full termination process.
6. Right to Affiliate Status:
A member terminated due to inactivity may request reclassification as a nonvoting affiliate, allowing continued participation without voting rights.
Reinstatement:
Members terminated for inactivity or failure to pay dues may be eligible for reinstatement upon fulfillment of any outstanding obligations or changes in circumstances. Reinstatement requests must be submitted in writing to the Council and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
Record Keeping:
All termination proceedings, including written notices and decisions, will be recorded and maintained in RIIS’s membership records.


This policy ensures fairness and transparency in the membership termination process while safeguarding the Institute’s ethical standards and scholarly mission.
