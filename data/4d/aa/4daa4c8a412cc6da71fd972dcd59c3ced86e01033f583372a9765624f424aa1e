1. Purpose and Scope


The Information Technology Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines the procedures to identify, respond to, and mitigate the impact of security incidents affecting the company’s IT systems. The goal is to minimize damage, restore affected services, and prevent future incidents.


This plan applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the company’s IT infrastructure, data, and resources. It covers cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches, malware infections, ransomware attacks, system outages, and unauthorized access.
2. Incident Response Objectives
1. Timely detection and containment of IT incidents to minimize the impact on business operations.
2. Safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access, loss, or corruption.
3. Restore affected systems and data in a controlled and efficient manner.
4. Maintain communication with internal and external stakeholders during and after incidents.
5. Prevent recurrence by identifying root causes and implementing long-term solutions.
3. Incident Response Team (IRT) and Roles
The Incident Response Team (IRT) is responsible for managing and executing the IRP during an incident. The team consists of representatives from IT, security, legal, and communications.
3.1 Incident Response Team Members


1. Incident Response Manager (IRM): Oversees the incident response process and coordinates the IRT. Ensures incidents are handled according to policy and communicates with senior management.
2. IT Security Lead: Responsible for identifying the scope of the incident, assessing the security breach, and coordinating technical containment, eradication, and recovery efforts.
3. Legal Counsel: Provides legal advice regarding regulatory requirements, data breach notification laws, and potential legal risks.
4. Communications Officer: Handles internal and external communication, including notifying employees, customers, and external stakeholders if required.
5. Forensics Specialist: Collects and preserves digital evidence for incident analysis and potential legal actions.
6. System Administrators: Assist in technical recovery, patching, and reconfiguration of compromised systems.
4. Incident Response Phases
The incident response process follows a structured approach to ensure that incidents are handled effectively, and the impact is minimized. The phases include:
 4.1 Preparation
1. Training and Awareness: All employees and IT staff should be trained on recognizing potential security incidents and following reporting procedures.
2. Incident Response Tools: The IRT should have access to monitoring tools, malware detection software, forensic tools, and communication platforms.
3. Documentation: Maintain updated documentation on IT systems, network configurations, access controls, and backup procedures to aid in response efforts.
 4.2 Identification
1. Monitor Systems: Continuously monitor network traffic, logs, and systems for signs of unauthorized access, unusual activity, or vulnerabilities.
2. Incident Detection: Use automated alerts, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and employee-reported issues to detect potential incidents.
3. Triage: Determine the nature and severity of the incident (e.g., malware, data breach, system outage) and assess the systems or data impacted.
 4.3 Containment
1. Short-Term Containment: Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent the incident from spreading. Disable compromised user accounts and block malicious traffic.
2. Long-Term Containment: Apply patches, install security updates, or implement additional safeguards (e.g., firewall changes) to maintain containment while preparing for eradication and recovery.
 4.4 Eradication
1. Identify Root Cause: Determine the origin of the incident (e.g., phishing email, vulnerability exploit) and remove the threat from the affected systems.
2. Clean Systems: Remove malware, repair or reinstall corrupted software, and update or reset compromised accounts and credentials.
3. Vulnerability Mitigation: Apply security patches, update firewalls, close unused ports, and remove any remaining vulnerabilities that may have led to the incident.
 4.5 Recovery
1. System Restoration: Restore affected systems from clean backups or reinstall applications. Verify that the system is functioning correctly without residual malware or vulnerabilities.
2. Monitoring: Closely monitor restored systems for any signs of further compromise. Ensure that all new security controls are functioning effectively.
3. Business Continuity: Confirm that normal business operations are resumed, and affected employees or departments are informed of any system changes or new security protocols.
 4.6 Lessons Learned
1. Post-Incident Review: After recovery, the IRT will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the incident, including what worked well, what failed, and what needs improvement.
2. Root Cause Analysis: Document the root cause and steps taken to prevent future occurrences. Ensure that logs and forensic data are preserved for future reference or legal purposes.
3. Incident Report: Prepare a formal incident report that includes the timeline, impact assessment, response actions, and recommended security improvements.
5. Incident Classification
Incidents are classified into different categories based on their severity and impact on business
              operations.
 5.1 Low Severity (Level 1)
1. Minor system disruptions or malware detections that have minimal impact on business operations.
2. Examples: Isolated virus infection, unauthorized login attempt.
 5.2 Medium Severity (Level 2)
1. Incidents that affect multiple users, systems, or services but do not result in data loss or significant downtime.
2. Examples: Localized ransomware attack, partial system outage.
 5.3 High Severity (Level 3)
1. Incidents that cause widespread outages, data loss, or security breaches involving sensitive information.
2. Examples: Major data breach, complete system failure, advanced persistent threat (APT).
6. Incident Reporting and Communication
 6.1 Incident Reporting
1. Internal Reporting: All employees must immediately report suspected security incidents to the IT department using the company’s incident reporting system.
2. External Reporting: In the event of a significant breach, external reporting may be required to regulatory authorities, partners, or customers in accordance with legal or contractual obligations.
 6.2 Communication Plan
1. Internal Communication: The Communication Officer will notify internal teams, management, and relevant departments about the incident status and recovery efforts.
2. External Communication: If customer or partner data has been compromised, they must be notified in accordance with data breach laws and regulations. The Communication Officer will coordinate public statements and media inquiries if necessary.
7. Forensic Procedures
 7.1 Evidence Collection
1. Data Preservation: When a security incident is detected, it is crucial to preserve logs, files, network traffic data, and any other evidence before eradicating or containing the threat.
2. Chain of Custody: All forensic evidence must be collected and handled carefully to ensure the chain of custody is maintained, which is critical if legal action is required.
 7.2 Forensic Analysis
1. Analysis: The Forensics Specialist will analyze the collected data to identify the cause of the incident, the methods used by attackers, and the scope of the breach.
2. Documentation: Detailed reports of the analysis will be created, including any findings that can help prevent future incidents.
8. Testing and Maintenance
 8.1 Incident Response Testing
1. Annual Testing: The IRP must be tested at least once per year to ensure that the response procedures are effective and up to date.
2. Simulation Drills: Conduct simulated incident response drills for common threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware, data breach) to ensure the team is prepared for real-world scenarios.
 8.2 Plan Maintenance
1. Updates: The IRP must be reviewed and updated annually or whenever significant changes are made to the IT infrastructure, threat landscape, or organizational structure.
2. Team Updates: Ensure that the contact details for all members of the Incident Response Team are accurate and up to date.
9. Plan Review and Updates


The Incident Response Plan must be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it aligns with
current cybersecurity threats, company operations, and regulatory requirements. Changes in technology, infrastructure, or personnel may necessitate updates to the plan.
