Organizations for by-laws investigation




Organization/Assignee name
* Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) (by-laws) / Anne Thessen (and I can also ask my friend with a non-profit management MBA)
   * Things I think are useful for Ronin:
      * Maintained in GitHub by a governance committee. Committee activities are transparent (recorded in a wiki)
      * Sections of bylaws are pasted below - seem like basic non profit stuff
      * Sections are minimalist
      * Specifics about voting, defining a quorum, membership, resignations
      * Duty of care and conduct stuff
      * Policies and procedures and position descriptions are separate from the bylaws
   * Things I think are not useful for Ronin
      * All the stuff about meetings

* NSF procedures for Grant Administration Disputes and Misconduct: https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf10_1/aag_7.jsp (Rami Saydjari) 
* Plan to call, ask specifics about what we as members of Ronin could and couldn't do to keep Ronin open, given the bylaws we have http://www.njnonprofits.org/ Elena- they do not accept calls, only email so sent email to center@njnonprofits.org 6/11/24, 1 hr before receiving the “Ronin Institute Update” email from the Ronin Board of Directors
* Neuromatch Institute/Nick Jackson
   * Neuromatch seems to have an innovative structure whereby the Board holds day-to-day governance power but one member is is selected by Neuromatch Academy, one by Neuromatch Conference, and the remainder by a majority vote of members.
   * Removal of board members occurs at a meeting of Members, but it seems that the board has control over scheduling those meetings.
