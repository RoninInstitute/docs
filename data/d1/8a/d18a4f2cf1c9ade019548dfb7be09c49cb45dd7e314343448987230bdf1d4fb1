If the board or committee makes adjustments to comparability data due to geographic area or other specific conditions, these adjustments and the reasons for them shall be recorded in the minutes of the board or committee meeting; any actions taken with respect to determining if a board or committee member had a conflict of interest with respect to the compensation arrangement, and if so, actions taken to make sure the member with the conflict of interest did not affect or participate in the approval of the transaction (for example, a notation in the records that after a finding of conflict of interest by a member, the member with the conflict of interest was asked to, and did, leave the meeting prior to a discussion of the compensation arrangement and taking of the votes to approve the arrangement);

ARTICLE X — CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY
Section 1 — Purpose of Conflict of Interest Policy: 
The purpose of this conflict of interest policy is to protect this tax-exempt corporation’s interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.
Section 2 — Definitions:
1. Interested Person. Any director, principal officer, member of a committee with governing board delegated powers who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.
2. Financial Interest. A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:
1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement;
2. A compensation arrangement with the corporation or with any entity or individual with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement; or
3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.
Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.
A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Section 3, paragraph b., a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.
Section 3 — Conflict of Interest Avoidance Procedures:
3.1 Duty to Disclose. 
In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
3.2 Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. 
After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion/presentation with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.
3.3 Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest. 
An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or committee meeting.
The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.
After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether the corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the corporation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
3.4 Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. 
If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
If, after hearing the member's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
Section 4 — Annual Statements:
Each director, principal officer, and member of a committee with governing board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement that affirms: 
a. The person has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy; 
b. The person has read and understands the policy;
c. The person has agreed to comply with the policy; and
d. The person understands the corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities that accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.
Section 5 — Periodic Reviews:
To ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:
a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining.
b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in insurance, impermissible private benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.
Section 6 — Use of Outside Experts: 
When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for, the corporation may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.
ARTICLE XI — CODES OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS[j]
Section 1 — Code of Conduct: 
A Code of Conduct acts as a foundational document for board members, outlining expectations regarding their behavior, decision-making, and interactions within the nonprofit organization requiring them to uphold the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, and the duty of obedience to RIIS. It serves as a guide to ensure ethical conduct, mutual respect, and professionalism throughout their tenure. 
Section 2 — Fiduciary Duties: 
Board members have a fiduciary duty, meaning they are legally obligated to act in the best interest of the nonprofit organization. Policies related to fiduciary duties clarify expectations for financial stewardship, appropriate use of resources, and avoidance of personal gain at the expense of the organization. 
Section 3 — Integrity and Transparency: 
These policies emphasize the importance of acting with integrity, honesty, and transparency in all aspects of board membership. They require board members to maintain confidentiality when necessary, avoid misrepresentation or misleading statements, and ensure accurate reporting and disclosure practices. 
Section 4 — Compliance and Legal Obligations: 
Nonprofit organizations in California are subject to various legal requirements and regulations. They must produce policies outlining the responsibilities of board members to comply with applicable laws, including those related to employment, fundraising, financial reporting, taxes, and other relevant areas. 
Section 5 — Accountability and Evaluation: 
Policies may include provisions on regular evaluations of individual board member performances, board effectiveness, and the organization as a whole to establish accountability within the board. These evaluations help identify areas for improvement and ensure continuous learning and growth. 
Section 6 — Best Practices and Continuing Education: 
Policies related to best practices and continuing education encourage board members to stay informed about nonprofit governance trends, relevant laws, and emerging practices. They may encourage participation in workshops, conferences, and training sessions to enhance the effectiveness of board members' contributions.

[a]JPT comment "these should be termed “Amended” bylaws, not “Restated”, unless you are redoing everything, in which case, they are just the Bylaws."
[b]In California major changes to the bylaws I believe requires calling them Restated. Other states may not have this requirement
[c]JPT comments "You should have a section (probably Section 2) describing types of members. You denote that someone can be an affiliate member with no voting rights. You also have regular members and Board members. You should state each of these along with a definition of each."
[d]Should we add a University degree as a pre-qualification?
[e]JPT comments "Should you address how the minutes of the meeting will be kept and made accessible to members? Or, you could reference Article IV, Section 6.2."
[f]JPT comments "Do you have or wish to have a limit on how long one member can serve on the board?"
[g]JPT comments "Paragraphs 1 and 4 essentially say the same thing. You should choose one (#4 is more complete)."
[h]JPT comments "The last paragraph doesn’t belong here unless you can show how it interacts with the Treasurer and treasurer-elect. Does this committee have supervisory oversight?"
[i]JPT comments "This is a repeat of Section 6, page 9"
[j]JPT comments "Should your codes of conduct and ethics also apply to members? You may wish to make this more broad."
[k]JPT comment "Consider the bylaws as your Constitution which lays out how things should be done legally. So, in this document, you should have statements that there will be no discrimination on whatever bases you choose. You should avoid proselytizing, though, as much as possible. You could have your Article XVII as an appended position statement, which would make this document cleaner. But, totally up to you and your committee. If you do leave it in, then you need to address whether there are consequences for failure to uphold these and who administers those consequences."
[l]JPT comments "you have 2 areas that need to be signed on 2 different pages (Pgs. 26 and 28). Is the last section simply for the Board? If so, it need not be appended to this document, but kept as a separate document that is referred to on Page 26."
