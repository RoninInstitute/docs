Whistleblower Policy  
 1. Purpose  
The Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship (RIIS) is committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and integrity in its operations. RIIS requires its directors, officers, employees, and members to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. This includes practicing honesty and integrity in fulfilling our responsibilities and complying with all applicable laws and regulations.
This policy is intended to:
1. Encourage Fellows, Councilors, employees, and volunteers to report concerns regarding unethical, illegal, or improper conduct.
2. Protect individuals from retaliation when they report concerns in good faith.
3. Establish a process for the confidential and prompt handling of reports.
 2. Scope  
This policy applies to all RIIS Fellows, Associates, Councilors, employees, volunteers, and other individuals associated with the organization.
 3. Reporting Responsibility  
All individuals associated with RIIS are responsible for reporting, in good faith, any suspected misconduct, including but not limited to:
1.  Fraud, theft, embezzlement, or financial improprieties.
2.  Ethical violations or conflicts of interest.
3.  Violations of RIIS policies or bylaws.
4.  Abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
5.  Violations of federal, state, or local laws relevant to RIIS operations.
 4. Reporting Procedures  
Reports should be made in writing and submitted to the RIIS Membership Working Group or if there is a conflict of interest with a member of the Working Group, directly to a member of the Council.  Reports may be submitted anonymously. However, anonymous reports should include sufficient detail to enable a proper investigation.
 5. Investigation and Confidentiality  
The Membership Working Group or an appointed investigator shall review all reports within fourteen (14) days and determine the appropriate course of action.
Investigations shall be conducted discreetly, and information shall be kept confidential to the extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.
If the report involves financial misconduct, the Treasurer and an independent reviewer may be consulted.
Upon conclusion of the investigation, a report including suggestions for appropriate corrective action shall be given to the Council for a final decision.
 6. Protection Against Retaliation  
No individual who reports a concern in good faith shall face harassment, retaliation, or adverse consequences.
Any retaliatory action against an individual who reports a concern shall be subject to disciplinary measures, including termination of membership, employment, or other RIIS affiliations.
If an individual believes they have been retaliated against, they should report the matter immediately to the Membership Working Group or the Chair of the Governing Council.
 7. Acting in Good Faith  
Individuals making reports must have reasonable grounds to believe that misconduct has occurred.
Malicious, knowingly false, or bad faith reports will be treated as a serious offense and may result in disciplinary action.
 8. Periodic Review  
This policy shall be reviewed periodically by the Governing Council to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
Amendments must be approved by a majority vote of the Council and communicated to all Fellows.
