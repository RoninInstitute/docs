RIIS Belonging Policy


Ronin Institute of Independent Scholarship (‘RIIS’) is an organization that celebrates the rich diversity of all the places in the world that RIIS and its scholars live and work. Our pursuit towards truth and empathy is deeply connected to our policies encouraging diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and respect for indigenous sovereignty to create a sense of belonging for all members. RIIS policies are essential to foster a convivial environment of belonging. RIIS acknowledges that in order to make meaningful change and have significant impact, it is important that our work represent and reflect the diversity not just within North America and Europe but humanities marginalized voices throughout the entire world.


RIIS and its board of directors, agree to be guided by these principles and pledge that they will be reflected in our vision, mission, strategic planning, programming, governance, and board composition. RIIS is committed to creating an environment that is diverse, inclusive, equitable, accessible and respectful of indigenous local context where all staff, RIIS scholars, partners, vendors, and board members are treated with respect and dignity. Our commitment also extends to programs we develop and support.


RIIS and its officers, directors, members, employees, and persons served by RIIS shall be selected in a non-discriminatory manner with respect to race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status such as disability, age, marital and family status, sexual orientation and gender identity, health status, place of residence, economic and social situation.

Local Context: RIIS aims to support effective and recognized pathways for implementing and maintaining Indigenous data rights and to facilitate ethical relationships that enable collaboration with stewards of Indigenous intellectual property, cultural and other heritage, genetic resources, and knowledge.


RIIS expects members to read, understand and abide by our founding values in all their interactions and scholarship. RIIS will not tolerate discrimination, biases, harassment, or bullying of any kind.

It also incorporates distinctions in backgrounds, beliefs, ideas, thought and values.
